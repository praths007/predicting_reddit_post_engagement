TIFU by cheating on my husband of 8 years with strangers on the internet.,223,uvkwj4,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/uvkwj4/tifu_by_cheating_on_my_husband_of_8_years_with/,1637,"I’m the asshole.

I got absolutely shitfaced at my friend’s birthday party last night which resulted in my husband having to come pick me up and take me home.
My friends hung out with me while I laid on the sidewalk puking on some mulch next to the street, giving drivers and bar-hoppers a good show.
My husband used my phone to check the parking app to ensure my meter was extended until we could come back and pick up my car. While on my phone, he looked through some apps of me conversing with random people I met on the internet.
I had been cheating on him in every sense of the word over the last few months.

I woke up to him saying he knows I’ve been cheating on him, he’s leaving and taking our kids with him to live with his parents (we moved to the east coast from the Midwest about 6 months ago), and that he is filing for divorce to include full custody of our 3 kids.

TL;DR TIFU by cheating on my husband with random strangers on the internet, and effectively blew up my life and everything he and I had built.

ETA: 
I’ve not provided context in this post because I know I fucked up and have been fucking up - providing any background would feel like I’m justifying my actions and I’m not. There’s never a good reason to cheat or hurt people.
I’m in and have been in individual counseling.
He and I have been in marriage counseling throughout our marriage.

TIFU by accidentally taking out my girlfriend's tampon.,77,yv4a7e,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/yv4a7e/tifu_by_accidentally_taking_out_my_girlfriends/,175,"TIFU by accidentally taking out my girlfriend's tampon. We were cuddling on the couch, and she wasn't wearing pants. She was wearing a big t-shirt, comfy clothes. She was wearing white underwear. 

I noticed a little string hanging out, but it wasn't the whole tampon string so I didn't know it was a tampon, I thought I'd do her a favor and rip off the string.

 I accidentally took her tampon out. Her face was priceless, I was dying of laughter, bloody tampon in hand. She was yelling, I was crying of laughter. When somebody else is laughing she finds it hard not to laugh so she started laughing, and then she got mad because I made her laugh. Now she won't talk to me, I even offered her hot cocoa and some chocolate snacks. 

She tries to do a little mad face, but always accidentally grins. I think it's cute, but honestly it's pretty gross once you think about it. :/

TLDR; I took out my girlfriend's tampon by accident while we were cuddling on the couch, now she won't talk to me.

Also, English is not my first language, but I’m working on it. 

This happened a little over a decade ago, and I had the perfect life; Great house, great husband, great car, great job. The American Dream.  Soon, that dream turned into a nightmare, when I discovered my husband was cheating on me. 

It started small, basically the typical signs(coming home late, ignoring attempts to get intimate, making excuses, etc.) Then, one day, I had a notion to go through his phone. 

HUGE mistake on my part! Not only was he cheating on me, but he was doing so, with a guy!!!! I’m ok with the LGBT community, and I don’t have a problem with my husband wanting to explore other sides, the problem is that he didn’t have the *Ahem* to tell me what he was doing. 

I had located the other guy, and we became fast friends. I found out, via the guy, that my husband had a Grindr (Gay dating app), and had hooked up with more guys. Together, the other guy and I came up with a plan. 

He had tricked my husband to agree to a hotel room that night, for some “alone time”. In the process, he had gathered some very incriminating evidence of my husband’s (what’s the word for “not being faithful?”), and thanks to my father, I had a Prenup that terminated marriage of said lack of faithfulness had evidence. 

My dufus ex husband showed up, while I was hiding in the bathroom. The other guy was playing his part well, telling my dope that he was going to the bathroom to freshen up. That’s when I came out, with the evidence, and the prenup, the section highlighted in the contract. I told him I was getting everything, and he was done for. He bolted. 

The fallout: 

When I took him to court for the divorce hearings, I had requested that I got the house and his car, since it was in my name. Thanks to Daddy Dearest, I was the primary breadwinner of our family, so I got what I wanted, and got to keep my assets. He lost everything but his crappy Nissan and his clothes. He had tried going back to the other guy, now my good friend, but that didn’t work. 

In the end, my ex had to move back in with his parents, and I think he’s working at Target, last I heard, I don’t care. Hell hath no fury like a Latina Scorned!",1649527143.0,Starlord215,True,False,False,0.51

What Happened with Items,0,wxykac,pathofexile,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/wxykac/what_happened_with_items/,5742,"Lake of Kalandra saw a number of balance changes that were not properly communicated before release. After a week of addressing feedback with hotfixes, we have written this post to explain what our intention was, what went wrong, how we have fixed it, and to reassure you about the direction we intend to go in the future.

There's a bit of backstory to explain. I want to start by describing three philosophies that have been guiding our decisions recently:

**Philosophy One: Reward mechanisms should scale properly with Item Quantity and Rarity bonuses**

For the last few years, we have been using what we internally call *item templates* to control what drops from league content. This is where a monster (often with a reward symbol over its head) drops a specific type of item when it is killed.

But Path of Exile is a game about opting-in to more difficulty in exchange for more rewards. You can roll your maps to be harder or add sextants to them. You can play with additional party members. You can trigger additional stacking league content like Delirium. All of these things make the game harder in exchange for *more* and *better* rewards. The way we achieve more and better is through item quantity and item rarity bonuses. Item quantity means you directly find more stuff, and item rarity means that it has a higher chance of upgrading to magic, rare or unique. Item templates ignored quantity and rarity bonuses. A template of ""drop four rare jewels"" just did exactly that, regardless of how much extra difficulty you had stacked.

Going forward, we are trying to make sure that reward systems scale with player item quantity and rarity bonuses. That's why the reward conversion system that higher-tier Archnemesis monsters have is so powerful. Any bonuses you have from additional difficulty will affect the rewards that the rare monster drops. Additional item quantity causes them to drop more items that are converted, and additional item rarity causes those items to upgrade, which also affects the converted one. For example if you upgrade a rare item to a unique item and it's then converted to a currency item, it'll drop as a Divine Orb, Exalted Orb or Orb of Annulment.

Going forward, we are trying to make sure that as much as possible, reward systems scale with the reward bonuses you get for playing difficult content.

**Philosophy Two: Players should fight fewer Rare Monsters at once, but they should be more challenging and rewarding**

In fights with a lot of Rare monsters on screen, you can't follow what modifiers they have, what skills they're using, and sometimes not even what type of monster they are. There's too much to pay attention to, with too much noise and screen pollution. You cannot use appropriate combat tactics, and instead have to just stutter step or be so powerful that it's inconsequential.

Fewer, more difficult rare monsters help you pay attention to what is happening, assess it, and act accordingly. It gives you an opportunity to employ counterplay and for your playskill to actually matter (rather than relying on pure character power). It is also a lot cleaner and far better for performance.

Rewards should be set appropriately for the increased difficulty of these rare monsters.

**Philosophy Three: There shouldn't be a large gap between the difficulty and rewards of league content and base game content**

Monsters added in leagues are more difficult to kill and drop better items than regular ones encountered in the base game. When those leagues become core, these properties carry across, creating two tiers of content, with one far more rewarding than the other.

We feel it's good for league content to be harder than the base game, and therefore more rewarding. But the difference should be approximately twice as rewarding. If the gap were any larger, then it would be less efficient to kill regular monsters and a player should spend all of their time focusing on repeating a small subset of content.

With those philosophies established, let's have a look at some changes we made in 3.19, and then examine what went wrong and what we're doing to address it in the future.

**Lake of Kalandra Balance Change: Rare Monster Normalisation**

A lot of league content was spawning way too many rare monsters compared to the rest of the game. In line with Philosophy Two, and general player concerns about being overwhelmed by too many hard Archnemesis monsters in some encounters, we reviewed most league content in Path of Exile with a goal of making the rate of encountering rare monsters consistent.

There are three changes that needed to happen at the same time as this:

1. The addition of interesting rewards to some Archnemesis Mods that scale with both Item Rarity/Quantity (Philosophy One) and yield very valuable outcomes if combined in the right combinations to create moments of excitement as valuable rewards drop.
2. An adjustment to the average number of Archnemesis Modifiers on rare monsters to increase difficulty, justify the higher rewards and create more random interesting encounters that add variance to gameplay.
3. A rebalance of Archnemesis Modifiers to account for the fact that rare monsters now have multiple modifiers more frequently. *This step was not performed until after release feedback came in. It was not deemed necessary at the time, and required extensive community feedback before we did it. This was a mistake and we should not have been so stubborn about it.*

**Lake of Kalandra Balance Change: Monster Item Rarity and Quantity Normalisation**

As described above, various valuable Archnemesis modifiers convert drops in a way that directly benefits from item rarity and item quantity bonuses. When we were balancing and testing this, we wondered why certain league monsters were dropping significantly more items than regular monsters. It turned out that this was due to item rarity or quantity bonuses that were historically applied to monsters to make leagues feel rewarding. When combined with the new drop conversion system, these bonuses stacked exponentially and caused far too many rewards.

In line with Philosophy Three, we rebalanced league monsters so that they were twice as rewarding as regular monsters and didn't have these existing bonuses. To be clear, the bonuses were inconsistent and arbitrary. For example, Yellow beasts dropped more items than Red beasts. Incursion monsters didn't have any Increased Quantity, just increased Rarity, but Harvest monsters had both. *This change was not mentioned in the patch notes.*

Now we get to Beyond. This was beyond broken for map juicing, sometimes spawning over 200 unique monsters in a map. The amount of items that came from Beyond was just ridiculous. It is not okay for fifteen thousand unique items to drop in the same map. The new version is more reasonable (allowing up to one unique beyond boss per map), which is honestly a gigantic nerf. But it was intentional, and we mentioned in the livestream it was reworked, with more details in the patch notes. While we took away the extreme juice opportunity, we added a dedicated reward for Beyond: Tainted Currency Items.

**What went wrong**

We didn't patch note the item rarity/quantity rebalance for league monsters. This was an oversight due to human error, but that's why I proofread the patch notes. Unfortunately, due to the next point, this wasn't caught during my proofread.

I… didn't actually understand the impact of the change. It was mentioned to me in passing (that we were removing the league monster bonuses and replacing with just quantity), and I didn't ask any more questions. I was busy, distracted, and should have sought more information. Had I understood the consequences, we likely would have still gone ahead with the change, but hopefully with better communication and maybe some pre- rather than post-release counterbalance elsewhere. This is a massive internal communication fuckup and I take full responsibility for it.

There was not sufficient time to playtest the change properly *for feeling.* It is unacceptable that I allowed a change like that to make it into the patch without a big chunk of time allocated to making sure the game still feels great afterwards.

I also overstated the impact of the change when communicating about it in [this post](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3296718). I said ""we removed a massive historic bonus"", and this caused the community to think the impact was larger than it was. The reason why I used the word ""massive"" was that the numbers sound big when viewed in isolation, but are less impactful when viewed in context. For example, the rarity bonus that was removed from a Red Beast was 750%. This sounds big, but a four-mod Archnemesis rare has a 41000% bonus. Players have been saying we massively reduced drops (throwing out numbers like 90%) but in reality, a large difference could only occur in the most extreme situations involving Beyond, Delirium and Incursion stacked with party quantity, rarity, sextants and scarabs and a dedicated MF culler (peak efficiency of every juice mechanism that exists). Every other player is unaffected on average. For example when playing Breach, the reduction in currency items found is around 7% (when comparing 3.19.0d to 3.18.1f). In 100% Delirium maps, the difference hits 17%. In Incursion and regular non-league content, you'll find 25% more.

The next mistake we made was related to item culling. I am pretty sure I spoke about this on a podcast at some stage, but a while ago we introduced a system that culls some percentage of irrelevant normal and magic items before the items drop, in higher-level areas. These are items that would almost certainly be filtered out by almost any item filter, and are almost never picked up. The intention is to reduce clutter substantially without actually affecting any items a player would pick up. We have been gradually raising this culling value over time as we try to find a sweet spot that has the best performance impact with no gameplay impact. To be clear, this system doesn't affect things like rare items, currency, maps, etc. A few weeks before Lake of Kalandra launched, we raised the rate again. This means that if you're counting the raw number of irrelevant equipment items on the ground, some of the reduction is due to this harmless culling system rather than actual drop nerfs.

In addition, Lake of Kalandra is an out-of-area league. Its rewards entirely come from the Lake itself, rather than from your maps. This is in stark contrast to Sentinel, our last league, which not only dropped rewards in your maps, but was honestly tuned higher than average in terms of league rewards. Players went from receiving masses of league rewards as they clear maps to receiving absolutely nothing from the league until they travel to the Lake. This is unfortunate timing and exacerbated the perception of drop reduction.

The Lake itself was also relatively unrewarding on release and this has since been massively increased since then.

The remaining things that went wrong pertain to post-release communication. It took us several days to hotfix many of the changes in, and while we have posted about it each day, this full explanation took almost a week. I wish we could have done it faster, but we have tried to prioritise working on the actual fixes as quickly as we can. As the confusion about our motivations has raised a lot of concern with the community, I should have found a way to prioritise writing this post.

**Improvements to testing and communication in the future**

There's a lot to unpack from the above pile of mistakes. I believe that the intention was good, but there were significant deficiencies in testing and communication. I take personal responsibility for those areas, because they happened on my watch. I'm the Game Director for Path of Exile 1, and it is absolutely unacceptable that I can miss a change that has the consequences that the league monster one did. Changes like that need to be very, very carefully tested, have their consequences fully understood, and then be communicated clearly. I have let you down and I will not allow it to happen again.

I want to emphasise that our Quality Assurance team are not to blame for the issues that were not discovered before release. They work really hard and have a lot of limitations that are outside of their control. For the next upcoming release, I am specifically trying to integrate them more into development so that we get their feedback earlier during the development of features.

**The direction from here**

So where does this leave us?

For players who are juicing their content to extreme levels with six-person parties, dedicated MF cullers and stacked league mechanics, they no longer have Beyond to push things over the edge. But they still find ridiculous amounts of stuff. I have seen parties in this league get multiple mirrors per day, or find over 50 Divine Orbs from a single monster.

For regular players who are just alching their maps and adding difficulty where they feel they can handle it, we think that drops are in a pretty good place after this week's changes. They should have been like this at release, and I am deeply sorry that they were not.

Our plan is not to gut the rewards out from Path of Exile. We play the game too and enjoy finding heaps of valuable items. Our ""*could an alternate version of the game with extreme item scarcity also be fun?*"" experiment, currently internally called Hard Mode, is an entirely separate thing and its changes have not been folded into regular Path of Exile.

Please keep the feedback coming. We are reading, discussing, and continuing to make changes. I'm very sorry for the rough start, but I hope you continue to enjoy the Lake of Kalandra, Atlas Memories, and other new content released in this expansion.",1661485522.0,chris_wilson,True,False,False,0.42

She calmed down and told me to go take a shower, so I did but when I came back, she was lying down on my bed watching the same girl on girl porn I had been watching when she'd caught me.

she invited me to join her, and we both enjoyed the new kink we'd just discovered. 

Fast forward to next evening and she tells me how it was so fun, and she was able to cum twice without doing anything; I felt good thinking she liked it more because it was her first time watching lesbian porn but she tells me she hasn't stopped thinking about what those two girls did in that video and that she has since masturbated twice to the thought of being in the middle of those girls. 

I didn’t say anything and ignored it as I thought she was just horny and wanted to go to bed for some sexy times.

But she starts to tell me how we’re both just 21 and should do things that only very young people like us would do, I ask her what she is trying to say and she tells me she would like to go to a sleep over and probably try out with her best friend what she saw in the porn, I couldn’t control myself and left the room saying if she wanted to break up she should just say it instead of making things up to try and make me get mad at her and then use it as an excuse for ending things with me; she starts crying and tells me how she can’t live without me and that she loves me but she wants to be able try a few things before it’s too late. 

Next morning after thinking things through, I told I am willing to give her time and that we will still be together, but she can do what she wants with that girl but on one condition and it’s that if she happens to realize she likes her more than me, she will break up with me or let me break up with her without making it a big deal. 

She agrees at first but tells after an hour that I should also come and play with them, I immediately reject the idea because at this time I’ve heard her talk about girl-on-girl sex more than 100 times in the last 48 hours so I told her she and her best friend both should do it alone and figure out what they’re. 

I don’t hear back from her for the next few hours and then I get a call from her best friend who she was going to sleep with, and she tells me my girlfriend enjoyed the threesome and that she wants to continue to keep trying it and that I am not to see her again, I didn’t understand what she meant so I asked what threesome and she immediately hangs up. 

I rang my girlfriend and it turned she went and slept with her best friend and her best friend’s boyfriend because her best friend didn’t want to do anything without her boyfriend. Now I am single and missed out on a great threesome opportunity.

**TL; DR. My girlfriend has threesome with her best friend and her best friend’s BF after I reject her offer of threesome and tell her to explore herself on her own and find out what she likes more.**",1649732388.0,biryanilover19,True,True,False,0.53

We should place a curfew forcing everyone to sleep/stay home at night.,10874,ww1hhx,unpopularopinion,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ww1hhx/we_should_place_a_curfew_forcing_everyone_to/,5822,"Get ready for a real unpopular opinion. Everyone should be forced to sleep/stay home at night. Yes, we can make exceptions for people running critical infrastructure, emergency services, nation security... etc, but the majority of people should be confined to their homes at night. Why? The reasons are numerous:

- The majority of property crime/theft/rapes/homicides take place in the cover of night. Anyone caught outside after curfew would be arrested. 
- A lot of health problems are caused by lack of sleep that the majority of people experience. This has a huge impact on our health services if everyone simply got enough sleep. 
- People in general are overworked and forced to work long hours that is not great for the human body but also for mental health. This would force employers to let their employees go home whenever the sun set. No more late nights. No more coming in extra early into work.   

- But, by far, the most important reason is that this would solve the energy storage problem that we face if we want to switch to renewable energy and stopping climate change. 

If we simply didn't need to power most of our activities at night, we could switch most of our electricity generation to solar power. We wouldn't need to build giant, expensive, toxic batteries for nighttime power. We would all work only at day time. We would build our products only during the day. Factories, malls, office building, and restaurants which use up ~80% of the power we generate would all be closed at night. We could use wind, nuclear, and some fossil fuels at night to meet the remaining needs for residential and critical services.",1661292200.0,fredsam25,True,False,False,0.56

My girlfriend fell off the back doing 90 on the parkway,0,wjyz0f,motorcycles,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/wjyz0f/my_girlfriend_fell_off_the_back_doing_90_on_the/,490,"For some reason I feel the need to tell this story. As it happened 2 days ago. My girlfriend has always supported my love of riding. Every time I would go on a ride, she was right there waiting with her helmet. Just 2 days ago from writing this, on the parkway while moving with traffic at 90 mph on my cbr 600rr she decided to put her hands in the air for a split second. I know she got that habit from me cuz sometimes I would do that at slow speed straight aways. 
Anyways, she decided to do it while going 90 mph and I felt my bike get super lite. When I looked into the rear view, I saw her in the air as if to still be sitting on the bike and I saw here tumble in traffic. I threw my bike down on the grass to the side and ran like hell to her. When I saw her tumbling I saw her shoes rolling and all sorts of debris rolling in the street. It honestly looked like body parts flying everywhere.
      I fucking lost it! I was sure at that speed that someone would def hit her. Luckily no one did. As I approached her, I was so happy to see her intact in one piece. As I was trying to take her off the road she said, “I’m so sorry”. I told her not to worry. Then she says, “be careful with me, my leg is broken.” As I look at her foot, I see it’s completely reversed with the bone sticking out. At this point I freeze up for like 5 long seconds. 2 other drivers pull up as I’m on the phone with 911. 
         Anyway, here is the kicker. A women pulls up and a guy gets out the car and tells us he’s an orthopedic surgeon in lower Manhattan. He took a look and said that he could set it back into place to save her from having a complicated surgery and to save her foot because there was no pulse there when he checked. He pulled out his card and said he would do it with consent. The state trooper, another biker who helped us and myself looked at each other then looked at my girl. And as she was crying, she yelled, “do it! Please do it!” And guess what? He did it right in front of us. He actually set it in place. When we got to the hospital, the resident surgeon was able to fix everything in a 1 hour surgery with minimal cutting. 
        She’s actually doing pretty good in recovery and best of all, she got to keep her foot because an off duty surgeon wasn’t afraid  to put himself out there to help someone. I still get PTSD from that day. I still debate whether to continue riding or quit all together. I know this was my fault and I never want to put anyone at risk. Ever again. I still love the sport of riding but you could be the best rider in the world and still face a ridiculous freak accident. And it doesn’t even have to be your fault. It could a driver, a pebble or anything. Even Marquez had wiped out a lot of times and suffered serious injury.

Hedgies decided to short America's favorite past time: BBQS & happiness. We must do this for the American Dream & short squeeze gains.

Weber $WEBR has a **2.83 billion dollar market cap**, but the **float is only $16.82 million shares**. The current short interest is at an **egregious 40.08% short interest (6.74 million shares of the free float).** The cost to borrow avg is 32.38% with the max at 74.75%. There are no additional shares available to short.  This stock is primed and ready to be squeezed.

Where does the 450,000 BCH number come from? Most likely they accidently gave away their BCH liabilities.

He's Gold 3 and I'm Silver 1. In the beginning he was pretty nice and was trying to teach me but he's very competitive and gets really angry with me because he thinks I'm not trying my best. Sometimes he even accuses me of trying to lose on purpose. He tells me I'm stupid, incompetent, or that I'm really a bronze player, maybe he's right. 
I do my best to practice, watch videos, deathmatch, etc. I'm happy with how I play, I'm not trying to be radiant or anything, but I don't seem to get any better, and this makes him upset. 

The problem is that all of a sudden, he told me I am too bad at the game, I'm never going to get better, and I'm holding back his rank, so he can't play comp with me anymore, only unrated. 

I wouldn't mind this so much except it feels like in unrated we get matched against really really good players. He checks everyone's ranks every game for some reason, but a lot of the time it's immortals, plats, etc. Almost never silvers. So every game I just get killed instantly over and over, then he gets really mad and insults me. But it just feels so unfair. I play a lot better in ranked because everyone is silver/gold, and I have a lot more fun. 

I know he wants his rank to go up, and I know I'm holding him back because I'm not good. But he asked me to play this game to spend time with me, and now he doesn't even want to anymore.

The guy I have been seeing for about six months asked if I wanted anything for my birthday, just a few days ago, to which I said “no,” because if you have to ask, I don’t want it. I was very firm in my answer because I was already insulted and I truly don’t need anything. Today the front desk of my hotel brings up a Cookies By Design basket to my room and I immediately thought it was from my employer as it’s such a basic, easy gift. I also assumed this because anyone that knows me knows that my health and anything that I put into my body is quite literally, top priority. I do not eat seed oils, artificial colors, artificial flavors, processed sugars, basically the entire list of ingredients in these cookies WHICH BY THE WAY is plastered on their website.

No ladies, it was not my boss. It was the guy I was seeing. I was floooooored. He knows I don’t eat out, I thoroughly inspect ingredients of new foods I buy, and I have informed him in great length the harms and studies behind some of the processed garbage he eats because he is too lazy to care. He knows how strict I am and he sends me THIS?! I can’t emphasize this enough, he KNOWS one of my absolute no-no’s is artificial colors and these cookies were covered with the entire rainbow.

On one hand I feel like perhaps it’s not a big deal, but for something that is so important in my life (my health), I just can’t believe he did this. He claims that I can “let go” for one day because it’s my birthday. I told him he could have sent a million other variations of food, things that he knows I like. Or I would have been open to trying new organic foods! I was just so hurt, I felt entirely unheard! He responded with, “great, next year you can guarantee to expect nothing.”

I should not have to explain myself, but I was more than kind and very meek when expressing how I felt about the cookies. I obviously said thank you but I also felt I had every right to explain how sad I was…and I get that passive aggressive slap in the face? Undeserved.

I blocked his number, deleted it and our messages from my phone, and asked the front desk if any of them would enjoy the cookies because they were received by an ex-boyfriend and unwanted in my space.",1643338085.0,,True,False,False,0.48

#Why do we need a megathread? 
LSF's goal has been to strike a balance between funny & interesting clips and news & drama. When drama hits LSF it usually takes up front page entirely. As a compromise for those that only come to LSF for funny and interesting clips and don't care much about drama, and to avoid drowning out other-topic clips, we've decided to create these megathreads. The main threads will stay up, however the rest will be removed and moved here to give visibility to different content on LSF. 
 
#How does this megathread work?

This megathread will be manually, and periodically updated with new information. If you have something new that you'd like to add to the megathread that is related, either modmail us or reply in the comments with any new relevant information.

#Have a suggestion?

Please [message the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=r/LivestreamFail) so that we can improve the process.",1663478426.0,LSFBotUtilities,True,False,False,0.51
The reaction to the roadmap roundup has only proven CIGs point and I am beyond disgusted. Grow the fuck up.,41,sj4sxp,starcitizen,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/sj4sxp/the_reaction_to_the_roadmap_roundup_has_only/,661,"There are some extremely vocal people on this subreddit and on spectrum who are proving CIGs point with every post. Every time you complain about a feature being removed you show your ignorance and immaturity, Every feature on that roadmap was *always* tenative, *always* subject to movement or removal at any time. It said so on the roadmap every single time you click into it. If you are disappointed by an item card being removed then thats on *you*. It has been drilled into yours, mine, and everyone elses head that everything is subject to change, the devs being super careful not to give dates because someone mentions a rough estimate and when it gets missed all of a sudden it's world war 3. Like i literally don't know how they could have spelled it out any more clearly. I understood, why didn't you? Couple of reasons i can think of, nothing kind.

You people, and you know who you are, no one else, are the reason that CIG has had to do this. You could have just said ""aww shucks the cards gone, no big deal i'll go play a different game until then"", but you can't because you're so invested in this thing, so beaten into it that you just have to throw a wobbler, harass the devs and cause shit like this. You're literally the reason we cannot have nice things.

We've all paid money into this thing, but some of us have long since learned that this is the way of it around here and throwing your toys out of the pram when that feature you were happy about got shit-canned 3 patches from now accomplishes nothing. We all want to see this game succeed. If you don't, why are you even here?

Demonstrates lack of maturity, however you want to take it. I don't care anymore i am fucking done with this place until release, and by the looks of it CIG are too. Nice fucking job.

Netflix cracking down on password sharing is reasonable,8754,w2ugom,unpopularopinion,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/w2ugom/netflix_cracking_down_on_password_sharing_is/,3239,"10,000,000+  households are using and getting value out of a subscription service for free thats intended to be paid for.

Netflix has turned a blind eye to this for over a decade and been super chill, but given the current market conditions it needs to show increased growth and its fully reasonable for them to go after the lowest possible hanging fruit, which is freeloading existing users on other peoples accounts.

I get that it seems petty for a massive corporation to try and get existing subscribers to pay for additional households or to block out 3rd or 4th devices on an existing account, but this was inevitable. It costs billions and billions of dollars to produce content, purchase licensing rights and host/distribute the platform. Not to mention their 10k+ high paid silicon valley employees and offices.

Netflix isn't a monopoly. There are cheaper alternative streaming services and sources of entertainment (Youtube is free, so is Ad version Hulu..). Netflix for trying to recoup money from freeloading users/generous friends isn't 'evil capitalism' and people bitching about it have just gotten so used to it that they forgot that they've been taking advantage ",1658241888.0,ChiefKingSosa,True,False,False,0.58
Some needed context on the Lavender Haze conversation from a queer swiftie,338,y04p1n,TaylorSwift,https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/y04p1n/some_needed_context_on_the_lavender_haze/,304,"I hope this post is allowed, I've seen surprisingly little discussion here and can't find a mod post or megathread on the matter, so I'm going to assume it's ok as long as the post doesn't break any rules. This is gonna be long but if you have time please read it. I'm not trying to stir up controversy, I've just seen a lot of casual homophobia recently amongst swifties and it needs to be called out.

TLDR: Lavender has been symbolic of queerness for over 100 years and we've used it to identify one another in times when it's not safe to explicitely come out. Taylor likely knew this and used it to describe her straight relationship and is encouraging fans to do so too. This dillutes the queer significance and makes it less effective as a signal to one another. Queer swifties who have called her out are being met with homophobia from a good portion of the fanbase rather than an effort to learn and understand.

In order to participate in this conversation, you have to understand queer flagging, and it seems that most straight fans have no clue what that is, so here's an quick overview:

We live in a heternormative world, where straight is considered the default. People often assume everyone around them is straight, and if you're queer, sometimes you need to gauge whether it's safe to correct that assumption. Straight people don't really have to think about being percieved in terms of sexuality or romantic orientation, but queer people are doing a constant calculation everytime we meet someone new as to whether it's safe and/or relevant for them to know who we are. Because it's awkward, stressful, and time consuming, queer people invented secret codes and signals (known as flagging or dropping hairpins) to communicate with one another and with allies who may be familiar with the signals. Flags can be clothing, accessories, words and phrases, hair styles, etc and have been used by queer people for centuries. They're usually not too obvious (like wearing a pride flag t shirt), because being subtle gives us plausible deniability if a homophobe recognizes it. Probably the most famous flagging example, though it's fallen out of use, is asking if someone's a ""friend of dorothy"". 

The problem with this system is it only works when the straight people are largely oblivious and unlikely to accidentally use a flag. Throughout history, common flags have lost their value to the queer community, either because too many straight people knew what they meant (like friend of dorothy), or because they became ""trendy"" and straight people started doing them too (like painting your ring fingernail a different color). Queer people have to constantly invent new signals which hinders our ability to safely communicate with one another. Lavender has been a common queer flag for over 100 years now (since long before the 50s), and is surprisingly effective despite how long it's been in use. I've seen a lot of straight people saying they had no idea Lavender had any queer significance, which is exactly the point. **It only works if most straight people don't know about it.**

That brings me to why Taylor's use of Lavender, in that particular context, is damaging to queer people. Lavender has lots of meanings outside of love/relationships, but in the context of love it has long been a queer symbol. I fully believe the story that Taylor found the phrase from mad men, and then googled it and found the urban dictionary entry about it being 1950s slang, but just because it was briefly an uncommon slang term in the 50s doesn't make it ok to try and mainstream it now as something non-queer; the queer usage predates the 50s and a good ally knows that just because you're not the first to appropriate something doesn't make it ok to do so. Until this week, almost no one except queer people were using lavender in the context of relationships. Now, Taylor nation is retweeting exclusively straight couples calling their relationships lavender, swifties on tiktok are claiming that the colour lavender has no queer significance and belongs to Taylor Swift fans, and googling ""lavender relationship"" brings up articles about her rather than the queer meanings. If this new meaning spreads beyond Taylor swift fans and into the general public, queer people will lose an important tool for safely communicating with one another.

If Taylor put this song out in 2012, I'd assume she just had no idea what Lavender meant to queer people. But Lover era made it clear that she knows queer history. Lavender is a pretty surface level flag, and with the theories that have been circulating about her for years, there's no way she and her PR team haven't done some research on queer symbolism to manage her image in that regard. If somehow she didn't already know, the fan reaction to the lavender vinyl must have clued her in. 

The knee jerk reaction of a lot of fans to defend her at all costs has them calling any queer people who call this out ""weird"" and ""chronically online"" or claiming that we're gatekeeping the colour (not the case, go ahead and wear lavender, call it your favourite colour, grow the plant in your yard, I don't care, just don't use it to market a song about your straight relationship to millions of people while encouraging them to describe their straight relationships with it and we're all good. I don't even have a problem with a straight artist having a lavender vinyl, it's just this song and its explanation that crosses a line). Straight people have so many beautiful metaphors and symbols they can use for their love songs. Taylor constantly refers to her relationship as golden, would ""golden haze"" not have been a better choice to maintain continuity in that metaphor and still hint at the mad men meaning without using a queer symbol? I hope she addresses it, but in the meantime, I hope the fanbase is open to learning and doing better.

So what should you do? For starters, don't harass people who point out the queerness of lavender. If you consider yourself an ally, listen to what queer people are saying about this. Queer people have so few symbols that have been ours for this long, and erasing the deep historical significance as I've seen a lot of swifties doing lately is incredibly harmful. Don't use Lavender in a heterosexual context. Straight people aren't banned from lavender or anything, just don't use it specificly in a relationship context, and let your straight friends who are doing it know why they shouldn't. There are lots of other colours up for grabs. Finally, call out homophobia when you see it in the fandom. We know Taylor wants her straight fans to be allies, and even though she messed up here, I don't think she'd like to see fans belittle us when we try to educate them on the history of our community and explain why certain practices are harmful.

Lots of love and appreciation to anyone who took the time to read tthis whole thing, sorry it ended up so long! I'd love to have naunced conversations about this and explain further if people need clarifications or are having trouble understanding why this upset a lot of queer people (and queer women in particular). Please resist the urge to dismiss this simply because it's critical of Taylor or because you associate this topic with speculation on her sexuality, which I'm not alluding to at all (imo her sexuality is irrelevant to this topic, the issue here is that she's using lavender to refer to a straight relationship, that would still be a problem if she's secretly queer). She's done a ton of good for queer people and I'm not trying to deny that, I just think this was a mistake and it's something that could become an opportunity for her and the fanbase to learn.",1665373795.0,Five9plus,True,False,False,0.54

"I'm honestly baffled by how pathetic, weak and delusional the West is.",3603,tbghh7,ukraine,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/tbghh7/im_honestly_baffled_by_how_pathetic_weak_and/,3053,"This will be an angry post. I warned you.

We've been fighting the Russian occupiers for more than two weeks now. Multiple war crimes committed, maternity house destroyed with Russians clearly planning this strike beforehand to blame us, and the West is still hesitant to provide us with lethal weapons. Because, you know, the WAR, not like there's a war already, but more of a genocide, might start. Like it's not happening already.

Let me tell you something - even if we fall, even if Ukraine is betrayed by the West and given up like Czechoslovakia once was - Putin won't stop. Just like Hitler didn't, because he wants to conquer all of the past Warsaw pact states. Because only by 'small victorious wars' like we call them (Russo-Japanese war for example) can he distract his people from what's happening inside their country. Because he wants a buffer zone from the NATO, which, to my belief, isn't even a threat or strong enough and would gladly surrender the Baltics too. Just because they 'don't want the nuclear war'. And it feels like the West will continue giving up countries and appeasing Putin, fearing the nuclear war. But the truth is, nothing stops Putin from sending the nukes. No amount of appeasement will quench his thirst for war. He does, because he can, and because no one stops him. 

So by giving up Ukraine (I hope this doesn't happen), or freezing the war, the West won't achieve anything but a delay of the inevitable - a continuation of his Invasion into Europe. Yes, just like with Hitler. I'm really tired bringing him up, really, but it seems the history is circular, and the West is not moved by my people getting slaughtered. Only by history references.

And thus, Putin needs to face the same fate as Hitler, because he already commits the unimaginable - a genocide, trying to terrorize us into submission and capitulation. And the West watches, trembling in fear, not even able to send us some jets. Only 'thoughts and prayers'. UN is particularly pathetic, in my opinion, and needs to be disbanded by how worthless it is. 

If he's not stopped here, the big bad WWIII will happen regardless. The only way to avoid it is to help us win and see Russia and its fascist regime crumble. Cause if we lose, you're next on his curriculum.

Updated: thank for all of the support and valid criticism. My post is really more emotional than I wanted it to be, and I think I got misinterpreted. I'm not saying the West doesn't help us at all or your support is wrong. I'm just frustrated by how slow it is, and how some European (and not only them) politicians say we need to negotiate with Russia just not to make it angry. Or, even, capitulate, accepting humiliating demands to recognise the occupation and promise to stay neutral. Because if we do, Russia will strike again. Putin's regime shouldn't be left standing, it's a threat to the whole world. And yes, we need air defense weapons. A lot. And currently they're not provided just because. It really frustrates me and makes me feel like we will be abandoned in the end. Thanks.",1646968354.0,IyyaLily,True,False,False,0.57

When I, and the world, were much younger, I was assigned to support an Army Aviation Support Facility in the Midwestern United States. I worked in Admin and Supply. Various duties - clerk, CO's driver, inventory, and (germane to this story) armed convoy guard. 

We (supply section) were tasked with transporting the weapons for one of the National Guard units our facility supported to the firing range located in another state. Since the only route was exclusively two-lane roads, and we had to be there early enough for the troops to get in a full day, we left EARLY, like 0200. Not even farmers were up. No traffic, nice. 

We made a pit stop in a small town, and when the drivers fired up their duce-and-a-halfs to head out, the lead truck driver radioed that his throttle was ""acting weird."" Note here that we always drove at the posted speed limit or under.

Pretty soon the lead truck was speeding along at 5-10 mph over the legal limit. My driver radioed him to ask ""wtf?"" 
Lead: ""my throttle's stuck wide open."" 
My driver: ""all your gagues green?""
Lead: ""yeah.""
My driver: ""ok, since there's not damned thing we can do about it anyway, we'll just keep going.""

About 10 miles on, we passed through a small town. No stop lights or signs. The lead driver plowed on, but a county sheriff was awake at 0345 and took exception. Lead driver shut his truck down and coasted to a stop, we pulled in behind the county mounty. 

Since lead truck was transporting  240 M16s, along with various other small arms, I, as the assigned guard, was carrying a M16A1 with a full thirty-round magazine. As I exited my truck at not-quite-a-run I racked a round into the chamber. The deputy must have heard, because he (probably reflexively) reached for his sidearm. Then looked at my weapon and my very serious expression and decided against that particular form of confrontation. I asked for his name and badge number before he could close his car door, or open his mouth. 

Lead driver came back to join us while I was explaining to the officer why it was my responsibility to watch and question HIM rather than the other way around. All according to Army regulations (I was regular Army) and State law (the weapons were property of the National Guard). You know, because it's my JOB.  

The lead driver explained what had happened, and then went to see if he could figure out what was wrong with his duce. The now eager to help deputy offered to wake up the hardware store owner for any parts needed. 

Which is the story of why I didn't have to shoot an Iowa County, Wisconsin Sheriff's deputy. Big sighs of relief all around. Too much damn paperwork.",1652649454.0,communismdontwork,True,False,False,0.49

The Uniparty are focusing on this trash because Biden is Dog Shit awful. The new Press Secretary literally said yesterday after a reporter asked her a question about why is Joe Biden at 33%? 

Answer: “We don’t follow polls. We are doing the work for the American people.” 

Translation: We know we are dog shit. 

Seriously have you ever heard of a Politician who doesn’t follow polls? 

Don’t forget it took two weeks to declare a “Winner”. Instead of on the night of. I remember checking my phone multiple days to see the refreshed results and nothing for weeks. 

Democrats know they rigged the results to kick Trump out. Then they installed 20,000+ National Guard Troops and walled up Washington DC with Military Style Fencing and Barbed Wires. In a “Democracy” that’s not fucking normal. In a Dictatorship that’s normal. 

Why do they hate Trump so much? That’s the real conspiracy. The Uniparty impeached the guy twice. And are still obsessed with him almost two years later holding these fraudulent hearings on something they already held hearings for. Why do they fear President Trump so much? Has he really done anything that differently from past Presidents? 

I truly do believe it’s because the elections are rigged. For my entire life it has gone 2 Term Democrats 2 Term Republicans. And when Presidents leave they stay gone and. You never hear from them except on rare occasions. 

President Trump is the only exception to this rule. 

The 2016 Election was truly different. I believe the Uniparty wanted Clinton in charge. They wanted the 1st “Woman”. Don’t forget almost all of the networks and newspapers had “Clinton wins in all caps”. Pre printed and released the day before results came out. And then had to retract it immediately. They got cocky. And didn’t do enough rigging.  They all thought he was a joke. So they got lazy. 

I believe the Trump hatred comes from this laziness and failure to correctly rig the Elections in the same way they got Sanders out. Almost 2 years later and the Uniparty are trying to prevent Trump from ever holding office again. That’s there stated goal. So they installed a guy with Dementia to have the ultimate puppet.

Next thing Binance did was closing our margin positions although there was more than enough margin — also without any explanations (or even notifications).

After a year of telling him the same thing, I was done.  When we broke up, he was shocked! He thought we were happy!  You have to give me a second chance!  You never told me there was a problem!

You'd really just rather stubbornly drive your head into a wall than re-think the way you play the game and build your characters?

Like I've seen a lot of people post that they died 100+ times in the acts and people seem to be in agreement that it's an issue with the game instead of questioning how in the everliving fuck it's possible for a supposed veteran player to die that much? Is it really because you're trying so hard to bruteforce your way to red maps where you think you can earn big bucks that you refuse to adapt in any way and play content appropriate to your character strength?

The game is meant to be complex, challenging and even a little unfair. They don't add things that make the game harder because adveristy makes the game more fun (which seems to be another common rhetoric), it's because overcoming adversity makes the game fun.

And I think ya'll should stop pretending you care about new players, they just make a convenient argument for you getting what you want.

It's a small coin for US & UK. Land of resources to be used.


It all started from 2014 when USA organized armed coup and threw off the current president at that time, who was in favor of working closely with Russia, even though hours prior to that different high level European politicians signed an agreement that would solve the current heated situation in Ukraine. So it was nothing, but a stab in the back.


That was spit in the face of Russia, because after the coup, USA obviously put their henchmen in power.


Russia reacted by sending troops into Crimea, which was logical, since the gigantic majority of the population was russian speaking and at that time, those who came to power were extremely nationalistic to the point of having direct ties with fascist political party.


Then the war began between two other Ukranian regions with Ukraine itself.


That was Russia's response to the armed coup in Ukraine. Move for move on the geopolitical chess board.


Neither of those 2 actions by both parties were truly legitemate. So you can't just support one side.


Then 8 year war followed that nobody in western media gave a shit about between Ukraine and its 2 regions that were supported by Russia. 


And now Russia started the war in Ukraine, because from their position they had no other choice.


Ukraine was being loaded with weapons, talks of taking Crimea back with force were written down in official documents, fascists parties were on the rise, potential of joining NATO right at the Russia's doorstep.


They had to react in this geopolitical chess game.


USA has been working on weaking and destroying Russia as it is since b.c.


They've succeeded with breaking the Soviet Union and after that the political rhetoric was that Russia is too big and it should be separated into 15 different countries.


Why? Because USA would easily control and manipulate them one by one. 


Divide and conquer.


And right now Russia is fighting whole NATO and Europe, since they are all sending weapons and mercenaries to fight against them.

Well.. including, but limited to:

&#x200B;

* no trauma helicopters were ordered. This is unheard of for an actual emergency.
* no paramedics were allowed in the school. This is unheard of.
* law enforcement parked 1/4 mile away upon arrival. Why didn’t they rush to the heart-wrenching emergency if it really occurred?
* officials refuse to say who declared all 26 people dead. By law, this must come from a doctor. This refusal of so much basic information indicates lies and cover-ups.
* official narrative claims emergency personnel didn’t find the school secretary and nurse after 4 hours of searching. this “event” included a traffic sign lit with the message, “everyone must sign in.” Officials refuse any comment on this element that would be present for a staged \* event/drill. porta potties were on site; again with no comment by officials and consistent with holding a drill.
* no names were listed for the 26 children and chorus director at the 2013 Super Bowl event in honor of Sandy Hook. The children resemble the alleged shooting victims. It’s unimaginable to not list these names for such a huge deal.
* no lawsuits filed by parents for negligence against school district. This is unheard of.
* a shooter with Aspergers would have poor motor skills and muscle tone – how did he carry all the gear and shoot with such precision?
* Newtown Public Schools refused to return calls regarding safety procedures. Non-cooperation to contribute information for other schools’ safety is unheard of.
* the FBI classified the report on Sandy Hook. This has never been done before, and indicates a cover-up of all the evidence that this was a staged event.
* radio transmissions are consistent in tone and content for a drill, not an actual emergency.
* multiple weapons reported at a limited crime scene were never found. This is not credible.
* law enforcement sent a kindergarten girl from the hall to stay at the crime scene of room 8 to be alone with dead bodies. This is a ridiculous claim that demands investigation and answers.
* no parents viewed the bodies of their children. This is also unheard of.
* no documents are being released via Freedom of Information Act requests. This is unheard of.
* trauma services were never requested. This would never occur.
* DNA Results eliminated both Nancy Lanza and Adam Lanza as the source of DNA found on the driver's side front door handle and driver's side exterior door handle on the suspect vehicles car as well as the gun
* tearing down the school is consistent with destruction of evidence, given the HUGE gaps between official accounts and the evidence. there’s zero evidence that a bio-hazard company was contacted to clean blood, bodily fluids, and officials refuse comment. This is impossible.
* Inquiries of who installed the school security system has been met with total silence. This is unheard of to not get this information to improve other schools.
* Absolutely bizarre characters/almost too obvious acting:
* “bodies” lined up in the parking lot covered in white sheets. But there were zero blood stains and police on the ground were just bumbling around, walking all over everything, and standing around chatting. Other random people seemed to be just stomping all over everything as well, and not in a sense of terror or traumatization, more like they were wandering around waiting for it to be over, socializing in groups, etc.
* Nancy Lanza was first reported as a teacher there but then after people saying they didn’t remember her it was just kinda swept away and never mentioned again
* Robbie Parker laughing/getting into character , Coroner Dr. Wayne/Carver , Gene Rosen.

Much more, but that should suffice to show that there is much here that doesn't add up.

Edit: Thanks for the comments. I'd like to point out regarding the aspergers claim -- aspergers and autism are diagnoses that used to be separate. At least  aaspergers was a diagnoses *on* the spectrum and that has changed. Regardless if he was still capable of killing and not just wounding 26 people firigng a bullet every second or 2, that is up for you to decide. It's merely a point worth mentioning. He was not one of the ""naturally ripped"" autism kids, as one of the commenters put it",1648701697.0,Logical_Capt,True,False,False,0.49

Every other post on here is an entitled whining session that serves no purpose other than to cry about why they're not getting what they want. Things like: 

\-GGG doesn't care about us. 

\-GGG wants us to fail. 

\-GGG devs suck

\-GGG wants to tank the company. 

\-GGG doesn't communicate

\-GGG is saying goodbye to the league. 

\-And so on and on and on. 

I see the same thing in streams and in Youtube also.  Do I think GGG has made mistakes this league? Absolutely.  Do I think they're purposefully tanking the in game experience for its players? Hell no. 

It's incredible to look back over the years and see how far this game has come and everything GGG has done for its players.  How many patches have they put out now to try to improve this league?  Would they be doing that if they didn't care?  

Please don't confuse this with agreeing with every change and every piece of their vision for the game. I think they're shooting themselves in the foot by being obstinate about some of the over-arching direction of the game, but I say that constructively because they are trying to do what they believe is best for the game. 

I also realize people have been attached to this game for a long time. Path of Exile is truly a love letter to the ARPG genre.    It's been a wonderful escape from reality for me for going on 10 years now.  

As consumers we have right to be upset when a company is putting out bad product. We don't have a right to attack people on a personal level like many in this community are though. I will state again, the posts that are nothing more than entitled shit posts do nothing to help with the current mental state of the community, nor improve the game. 

Instead of flailing into the darkness with insane conspiracy theories about how GGG doesn't love us, talk to us, play their own game, etc, we could spend that time providing constructive, well thought out feedback that may actually give them a better understanding of the voice of their customer. 

I personally think GGG should send polls to their players from time to time soliciting feedback on various aspects of the game.  Then they can compare their data with what the customers are saying. 

Here's an example of something not helpful: 

""GGG has given up on the league. Their devs are hopeless and the game just sucks right now. I hope they burn.""

While very passionate, it does nothing but portray a false narrative.  

This would be a much better way to phrase things and may actually help at least articulate what's going on. 

""So far my league experience has been lackluster.  The league mechanic doesn't seem to proc enough to make it worth running and when you do run it, the mobs seem exponentially overtuned as you progress.  Also there seems to be very little loot dropping from the tiles in comparison to the difficulty of running them.  For example I ran I difficulty 10 Tier 4 Tyranny tile that took me 3 portals and 5 minutes to clear and the currency chest that spawned only dropped an orb of alteration."" 

If we as a community strive to provide actionable feedback, we may get actionable results instead of the staff at GGG feeling like we're coming at them with torches and pitchforks. 

That's my .02 for the current state of things. Hope those of you still playing can find some enjoyment in the game still and if not, take a break, and come back next league to see if you like it better.",1663166257.0,I_M_Jason_Gaming,True,False,False,0.56

Still went shopping, eating out, parties, etc. Still very much alive & healthy, like everyone else.",259,tx063d,conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/tx063d/never_wore_a_satanic_maskfacediaper_once_never/,1014,"If the psychotic sociopathic narcissists (aka ""globalist"" aka self-proclaimed ""elites""), etc try to impose their satanic/demonic things on you again - say NO. Do NOT comply. You do NOT need ""permission"" from ANYONE, ESPECIALLY not psychos that have been planning this psychotic plan for decades (which btw CAN be changed, and IS being changed).

a) You NEVER needed ""permission"" to not suffocate yourself. However, if you feel the need to not do so - pretty much EVERY SINGLE ""mandate"" and piece of legislature WORLDWIDE has/had an ""exemption"" clause. AKA - if you can't breathe - congrats, you are exempt - and NO ""proof"" required. If you go somewhere - you simply state you are EXEMPT - and POOF! like a magic trick - the NPC's leave you alone.

b) For the deathjab/poisonprick/etc - you ALSO never needed to feel pressured into that. Like the satanic face cloth covering, there are exemptions for that as well, pretty much WORLDWIDE as well. Yes, the psychos tried to ""pressure"" people, coerce them through threats of violence and threats of poverty - but STAND YOUR GROUND AND SAY NO F\_\_KING WAY.  It is/was basically a game of ""chicken"" to see who would blink first. People who stood their ground and said f\_\_k off are now getting offered their jobs back, in many cases with signing bonuses.

c) The psychos are trying to manipulate people through FEAR of ""death"" and FEAR of ""poverty"".  Say NO to the fear. (Spoiler alert, if you haven't figured it out already, there never was a ""contagious"" virus. if you got 'sick', it was probably from stress, suffocating yourself, breathing in bacteria from a 'mathsk', shoving a stick up your nose, etc, etc. Read up on things like terrain theory, event 201, spars pandemic 'planning' exercises, numerous countless books on 'viruses', what they are, and what they aren't, how the 'convid virus' was 'patented', etc, etc. Use things like duckduckgo, brave browser search, etc to find things that the insane psychos are trying to hide from you).

GOING FORWARD:

a) Choose your OWN destiny. You have the creator spark, you can choose. The psychos are weak parasites. They try to use deception & manipulation to manipulate your actions, say NO.

b) Do NOT comply to any psychotic demands. Say NO. While you never ""needed"" permission - the psychos seem to have out clauses if you feel you need it. So use them if you feel that need. But say NO to the psychotic demands. Hold them accountable for their sick, evil disgusting warped insane plots, and vanquish the evil.

c) Write down the type of reality YOU want to manifest. Where the attention goes, the energy flows. Emotion (""e""-""motion"") is energy in motion. Direct your emotion and energies into GOOD. Fight the evil, vanquish the evil. Just do it.

Make the world a wonderful, beautiful, happy, good place.

r/Halo Is Back Open,178,r9t5ng,halo,https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/r9t5ng/rhalo_is_back_open/,0,"EDIT - Since some people are still confused about the cause of the lockdown:

**The primary cause was users on the sub directly harassing, insulting, and being toxic to each other for having different opinions.** This level of animosity and overall anger manifested itself in different ways, including rare cases of doxxing and death threats. The lockdown was not solely due to death threats. The lockdown was not to stifle or remove criticism against the game or 343; the front page for the entire lockdown was filled with criticisms, and the front page now post-lockdown is topped by new ones. Respectful criticisms and disagreements will always be allowed. Insulting others is not.

---

[The r/Halo lockdown has concluded](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/r97dai/temporary_rhalo_lockdown/) and submissions have reopened.

To the people who supported it and sent words of encouragement: thank you. To the people upset by the decision: we understand, but we felt the lockdown was necessary due to the sheer amount of exponentially-increasing toxicity between users. At the end of the day this is a video game, and the level of animosity surrounding it got far out of hand and out of proportion. The subreddit needed to hit the pause button and reset so people know what is and isn't acceptable. Insulting people for having a different opinion crosses that line. Doxxing and sending death threats absolutely also does.

The lockdown acted as a warning. This is how things will be moderated going forward:

* The number one goal of the mod team is civil discussion. Insults will be met with longer tempbans. People coming here specifically to antagonize other users will not be allowed. If you see people breaking our rules, report them using Reddit's report button rather than breaking the rules yourself and actively making things more toxic. If something you've reported hasn't been gotten within a couple of hours, feel free to send it to us in modmail.
* *Constructive criticism and feedback has always been allowed and will continue to be allowed.* Low-effort rants and threads that are borderline duplicates of existing threads will be removed. Criticism is not an excuse for and doesn't allow directly insulting or antagonizing other people.",1638748672.0,-343-Guilty-Spark-,True,False,False,0.54

# The Technicals

2022's first half was the worst half to a stock market year in the last 52 years. This saw the S&P 500 move down from 4,818.62 to 3,636.87. This is a range of 1,181.75. Of this range, an ideal fibonacci retracement (bear market short-term rally) would be 61.8% back up in this range. That takes us 730.32 up from 3,636.87 which gives 4,367.19. Yesterday's high was 4,325.28. This high was within 1% error of the ideal 61.8% Fibonacci retracement.

Thus, the 50 Week Simple Moving Average of the S&P500, as a further catalyst for resistance, will reject the S&P500 down, thereby allowing for the horrible stock market downturn to continue.

That said, the first half of 2022 was the worst in 52 years, the third quarter was one of the best, and the fourth quarter may end up being the worst stock market quarter on record. Here is a visual:

# 1929-crash-like Margin Deleveraging

[FINRA Margin Statistics](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/margin-statistics) has been updated to include July. As expected, we got a slight reprieve in debit balances in customers' margin accounts. Nevertheless, graphing the data and adjusting for the near-record inflation for each data point, we can see that we are still in the worst bubble by value in the history of the stock market.

Fibonacci of this graph shows that Margin has to collapse up to $370 Billion more from August's expected margin value), depending on the strength and speed of the deleveraging.

FINRA Margin Totals, Adjusted for Month-by-Month Inflation. Dotcom crash (left bubble), 2008-2009 crash and great recession (middle bubble) and the current bubble (right). Fibonacci retracement values are listed for 61.8% and 78.6% of each deleveraging period. One can observe that the bottom of margin deleveraging bottoms within that range, depending on the strength and speed of the unwinding. (61.8% seems to correspond to slow and weak, and 78.6% seems to correspond to fast and strong). The data shows that the market will continue to deleverage and crash

&#x200B;

# TLDR:

Unfortunately, summer is ending. The short-term rally has expired, as technicals show three problems for the stock market: 1: A perfect rejection off the S&P500's 50 week Simple Moving Average, 2. The 61.8% retracement already happened, and 3. A perfect rejection off the S&P500's 200 day Simple Moving Average. In a 1929-like scenario, total margin (and adjusted for inflation) shows that we are still in the largest margin bubble of all time. Fibonacci levels on the inflation-adjusted FINRA margin data show that the market has to still undergo up to $370 Billion of deleveraging. Therefore, I am hereby predicting that the fall and winter months of 2022 will be some of the worst months in stock market history. Leading market strategists such as Dimon, Zuckerberg, Musk, Novogratz, and even Warren Buffett concur, and some say that 2023 will be a Depression. Will 2022's crash lead us into 'the greatest depression,' and do you think Warren Buffett will die \[either because of or\] during this crash/depression?

I think we get womansplained all the time,7145,ylcfss,unpopularopinion,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ylcfss/i_think_we_get_womansplained_all_the_time/,1091,"Before I wrote this post I have been searching online if womansplaining is a thing and if there are some good examples. Most of the times they say it exists but I couldn't find any good examples. But womansplaining is happening all the time and it already starts at a verry young age. 

So let me take you to my previous weekend; I was at a party. Everybody had some beers, there was some nice music in the background and in general I was having a good time. After some time they started to make some snacks, first we had some oven snacks and some cheese blocks. 
But then they started to make mini ""pizza's"". It was put in the oven for +-10 minutes.  They were finished and getting them out of the oven was already a lot of work. To get the plate out of the oven you had to tilt it a bit and therefore all pizzas would fall on the bottom of the oven. Therefore we decided to get them out one by one.

You maybe already guessed, 10 minutes wasn't enough and the middle of the pizza was still frozen. Then we realized we didn't preheat the oven and didn't put it on the right temperature. The normal not that sober mistakes. So we were having a discussion and nobody wanted to put the pizzas back in the oven one by one. 

And this is the moment. 

So I decided to say I will try to put them on the plate and try to block the fall of the pizzas with a peace of baking paper. I knew the risks and then it happened. I slightly burned myself. 
While I was trying to get the pizzas in and the whole time nearly burning myself(and my friends laughing). From the other side of the room a girl joins the conversation to start to to explain me that it was dangerous what I was doing and that I could burn myself again. She was acting as if I was stupid, but I was just taking a calculated risk. But she really thought I was stupid. 

And then it hit me. Womansplaining is mostly when guys jokingly in a funny way do something and a girl starts to explain its dangerous. 
WE FUCKING KNOW. 

When we go with 5 friend in a shopping cart and race down a hill. NOBODY HAS TO TELL US THIS IS DANGEROUS

When we want to fire fireworks from our asscracks. NOBODY HAS TO TELL US THAT IS DANGEROUS

When we  climb a tree to the top and we here a cracking sound. WE KNOW

When we try to drink more alcohol in a drinking competition. WE KNOW

When we are working on the electricity in the house and decide not to take the power of. WE Know. And when we get a shock, don't tell us we should have put off the power - _- we know

Womansplaining is a bigger problem than most of us realize.",1667504279.0,Same-Handle-5654,True,False,False,0.59

Your child should know basic gun safety by age of 7.,13263,s25esh,unpopularopinion,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s25esh/your_child_should_know_basic_gun_safety_by_age_of/,11139,"If your kid doesn't know how to properly handle a firearm by 7 years old (hell earlier the better) then you did something wrong as a parent. You should be able to put a loaded handgun on a table and your child should know not to point it at anyone and should be able to check if its loaded and always treat a gun as loaded no matter if it's loaded or unloaded. That's basic safety. Always treat a firearm as if it was loaded. Double check to see if it is or isn't loaded everytime you pick it up or hand it to someone. You should be able to trust your child with a handgun but keep them supervised at all times and keep your guns safe people. Unpopular opinion but that's why it's here. If you live in America or any other countries were guns are legal (even if you don't have them personally) teach them gun safety.

Edit and clarification 
The amount of people not understanding my post is kinda mind boggling. Teaching your kids to respect dangerous things such as a busy street or train tracks is important. Teaching kids not to run Infront of a moving car is important just like teaching kids to not play with guns. Guns are not toys and streets are not playgrounds. I never said kids should be able to be able to defend themselves with a gun (like some comments are assuming I mean by handle) that's crazy. thinking kids will never cross a street is crazy. And in some areas and especially parts of America (but any country that has guns not just America) kids are going to encounter a gun. Being able to check if it's loaded and being safe is important. Just like being able to realize if a car is on. or not. Kids shouldn't be around cars with the engine running by themselves same thing.
Edit 2
It's funny, after over 11,000 ish comments ive notice something. Non gun people think that when I talk about kids using/handling/holding/shooting guns they think I mean: kids should fight in wars (no like fr some people actually said that), kids should be responsible for home defense, kids should use the guns unsupervised (I've always said they should be supervised so idk why people keep saying that). While gun people just assume (or they also read one of my hundreds of replies) that's I mean at the shooting range and with supervision. I grew up with guns at an extremely young age. First time I've ever shot a gun I couldn't of been much older than 4. That's normal for lots of folk. Lots of kids go hunting with their dads and grandpa's. Some of my best memories are going to the range with my dad and shooting so many rounds our hands hurt. So when gun people read my post they just know because it's mostly shared experience. It's not normal even gun nuts to see kids with guns unsupervised. Kids unsupervised should avoid guns like the plague and tell and adult immediately.",1641991410.0,RareSiren292,True,False,False,0.59
I’m sick and tired of the same excuses drivers come up with to continue burning gasoline on a warming planet,167,yqih72,fuckcars,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/yqih72/im_sick_and_tired_of_the_same_excuses_drivers/,685,"Whenever you confront any driver of a gasoline car about their greenhouse gas emissions and the fact that their means of transportation is completely unsustainable, they always bring up one of the following excuses, which are all equally unjustified:

**“My emissions are nothing compared to those of corporations. Corporations are responsible for way more emissions than I am.”**

This is true only if you compare your own emissions to those of corporations, which is meaningless. Transportation is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Put together, the emissions of all drivers of a nation combined add up significantly and contribute to the greenhouse effect, which in turn causes the planet to warm up, which in turn ends up completely destabilizing Earth’s climate. Traffic is also one of the main contributors to air pollution. Stop shifting the blame on oil companies when you yourself directly contribute to their revenue by filling your tank at the gas station.

**“I can’t afford an electric car.”**

No one said you had to drive a car and exclusively move around inside a box. There’s other means of transportation that exist. You should consider them when our planet’s climate is destabilizing.

**“I don’t have a choice. I need to drive to get to work.”**

You *have* a choice. You can take public transportation, ride a bike (regular or electric), ride an electric scooter or walk instead. You can physically do it and you should when our planet’s climate is destabilizing.

**”Driving is faster than biking or waiting for the bus.”**

Commute times should be the least of your worries when our planet’s climate is destabilizing.

**“There’s no infrastructure to bike where I live.”**

Any road can be used as a bike lane. People simply need to actually start biking on it instead of driving, and they should when our planet’s climate is destabilizing.

**”The infrastructure isn’t ready yet.”**

We don’t have time: not only is our planet’s climate destabilizing, it’s destabilizing quickly. We can’t wait for entire highways, suburban areas and cities to be reshaped from the ground up. We have to work with what we already have, which is roads, on which it’s perfectly possible to add more buses and bikes.

**“My workplace is out of reach of biking distance.”**

Consider a trip that combines public transportation with biking. If you can’t, then consider finding another job that’s closer to you or working from home. Getting to your preferred workplace shouldn’t be the priority when our planet’s climate is destabilizing.

**”I’m too ~~lazy~~ weak to bike.”**

Unless you’re very old, very obese or have a serious health condition, this is most likely just laziness on your behalf. You *can* put in the effort, especially when our planet’s climate is destabilizing. Electric bikes also require less effort.

**“I can’t carry my groceries on a bike.”**

There’s all sorts of specialized bikes available that are designed to carry multiple items, including groceries. You could also let a family member carry the other half of your groceries on their bike, divide your groceries into multiple trips, or even reduce your consumption altogether, which is good for the planet. Consider all of these options when our planet’s climate is destabilizing.

**“I can’t ride a bike in the cold.”**

Wear multiple layers of winter clothing to protect yourself from the cold. Make the necessary sacrifices when our planet’s climate is destabilizing.

**“Not everyone can easily maintain their balance on a bike.”**

Then go for an adult tricycle instead. Don’t set that option aside so quickly when our planet’s climate is destabilizing.

**”There wouldn’t be enough buses to carry everyone around if all drivers were to give up their cars.”**

If more people end up paying for public transportation, the transportation authority could afford putting more buses on the road. Since a single bus can remove up to 50 cars from the road, or an even higher number in some cases, emissions would go down considerably, especially through the use of electric or hybrid buses, which would be a great measure to prevent our planet’s climate from destabilizing.

**“I don’t like waiting for the bus.”**

Bring something to keep you occupied, such as a book to read. Waiting for the bus should be the least of your worries when our planet’s climate is destabilizing.

**”I don’t like how crowded mass public transit is.”**

Comfort should also be the least of your worries when our planet’s climate is destabilizing.

**”How can I carry cat litter from the grocery store on a bike?”**

Are you serious? This is the most important drawback you could think of?

**”Your use of a device that’s connected to the Internet also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.”**

This doesn’t change the fact that your gas vehicle emits greenhouse gases. You’re not solving anything by pointing to another problem. Stop deflecting the specific issue we’re focusing on.

**”[Insert country] and [insert country] emit more greenhouse gases than we do.”**

This doesn’t change the fact that your gas vehicle emits greenhouse gases. You’re not solving anything by pointing to other countries.

The bottom line is: if you drive a gasoline car, whether you admit it or not, you directly contribute to the greenhouse effect and global warming. Combined, greenhouse gas emissions from transportation add up to amounts that aren’t insignificant at all. You can’t shift the blame on “corporations” or “infrastructure” when you pay oil companies at the gas station and refuse to bike on already existing roads. Stop being in denial. Stop being a hypocrite. You have absolutely no excuse not to switch from your polluting vehicle to a more sustainable means of transportation right now.

In middle school, he was I would say about above-average. He was a math prodigy, made up his own language, aced his classes and was a wiz, although socially stunted. Then puberty hit, he stopped going outside, and he started destroying his and me and the wife's property. We loved him enough to let it slide though, and he lived with us along with the occasional stay at a psych ward.

Yesterday he killed our family cat after having a meltdown due to us trying to take his computer away after me and my wife caught him looking at anime hentai of girls who looked to be about five. He threw my prized high school football trophy (wherein I won state) at the poor thing, causing its skull to split and its brains to spill out.

I just about had it with them, wailed on them, threw him on the curb, and tossed his computers and gaming systems with him and told him if he ever came back I would KILL HIM.

Downtown crime scare is a suburban problem,0,u09vak,Seattle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/u09vak/downtown_crime_scare_is_a_suburban_problem/,248,"First, facts. I live in West Seattle and took the C line downtown to this afternoon's Kraken game. We took lime bikes to the game and walked back, 3rd & Pike/Pine to Seattle Center. Color this report a single anecdote or whatever, but we saw dead zero of what Seattle's uptight media (broadcast+ social) and SPD/SPOG have characterized as a plague of violent/personal/property crime. One mile each way, navigating 2nd, 3rd, & 4th Avenues, and the scare factor was zilch. 

Now, feelings. I worked downtown for a while pre-COVID when 3rd Ave bus stops were the hubs of crime. It was the only area where there was any visible crime. Not exaggerating, but also not including losers selling one another pills and trash. I've had an unlocked bike stolen and I did a Bike Batman recovery on a craigslist thief and commute by bike through downtown daily. So I am not sniping from Shoreline and I am not a fan of persistent low-severity crime either. 

Now, my point. Online Karens have made a stink about an eyesore. There is the KOMO and talk radio audience and the social media rebroadcast of their inaccurate sensationalism. We're all familiar with it. Add in the downtown business owners' smear campaigns to flip the mayor, AG, and council offices as well. I have to wonder whether they're playing a long game or trying to exploit a convenient hysteria. The motivation seems more for online attention than actually solving anything. 

Regardless, here's the other side of the paradox... downtown is not crowded. Wouldn't an embrace of downtown and a flood of post-pandemic commerce & culture kill two birds for both business owners and scaredy cat Karens? The idea seems lost to the media, tbh. KOMO's buzz bled into other sources' newsrooms and Seattle is now a nationally recognized example of rampant crime, and I'm arguing it is a non-issue. 

Come at me, but have a 1st-person anecdote. My point: downtown needs non-criminals to outnumber the tiny number of criminals, and pandering to scaredy cats on TV and online is stopping people from visiting. That's it, not controversial  In your response, include the word ""shampoo"" or we know you didn't read this.",1649564176.0,iwasbornlucky,True,False,False,0.5

1. Economy was much better in USA and around the world. Around the world because in the USA politics depended lot of other world politics
2. No Covid or things like this (EDIT: excluding the last year and we know why. Because at the 2020 Davos meeting he gave them the middle finger and 1 month after covid appeared)
3. Edit: He was against lockdowns.
4. No wars.
5. No high prices in the goods and services.
6. Russia didn't attack Ukraine (that the MSM narrative is spinning every problem atributting it to Russia).
7. No threats from NK. He actually met with Kim Jong, and they respected him.
8. Putin respected him.
9. Leaders around the world respected him (excluding the deep interstate).
10. Nominated 3 or 4 times for Nobel Prize (but ultimately Joe Biden and Kamala got it lol EDIT. I WAS WRONG. THEY WERE NOMINATED FOR IT, BUT DIDN'T WIN IT!).
11. People in the USA loved him. They understood very well that MSM and deep-state did EVERYTHING in their power to weaken him, prosecute him, impeach him and everything.
12. He actually cared about USA and it's citizens.
13. Did everything in his power to build the wall so the illegal immigrants could not enter (and subsequently invade USA and ultimately to vote illegaly for the DP).
14. During his Presidency, Epstein was arrested.
15. During his presidency, Maxwell was arrested.
16. Lots of operations succeeded putting in jail, drug traffickers, children traffickers etc.
17.  Extension of the post 9/11 GI Bill. [He removed the 15 year limit,](https://militarybenefits.info/forever-gi-bill/) and now veterans and their families can use the GI Bill “forever” instead of needing to use it within 15 years.
18. Trump signed the First Step Act, which was at least a small step toward prison and sentencing reform. Of course, Congress deserves most of the credit, but at least Trump was in support of it. 
19. When John Bolton was in the Bush administration he was a proponent of invading Iraq. As National Security Adviser to Donald Trump, he advised pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal. In 2019, when Iran shot down a US drone, John Bolton wanted retaliatory strikes on Iran, which Trump stopped and was quoted as saying, the strikes were ""not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone."" 
20. No wars.

As an European citizen, watching how things are unfolding since the Davos meeting in 2020 (where everyone was against Trump) until this point in time, I would like him again as a president.

And yes, I think the election was stolen and please spare me...but but people voted him because he was arrogant. Look what you have now in Presidency. Since this dude came in presidency it's only wars, failures, high prices, masks, mandates, vaccines, crime and the current US politics are impacting the whole world in every single step and direction.

It was a big fat conspiracy to remove him of presidency because he hindered for 4 years straight every single plan they had, and that's why people are awake now, because they're behind with the plan and trying to catch up and they can no longer move in shadows and do things quietly, they have to rush, and now everything is clear as cristal!

Cars are one of the worst inventions in modern history.,19397,umhf4d,unpopularopinion,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/umhf4d/cars_are_one_of_the_worst_inventions_in_modern/,4973,"They contribute to environmental damage, are responsible for mass death across the U.S., and incentivize bad public infrastructure.

I say this as someone who loves the damn things. I grew up incessantly watching Pixar’s Cars, Herbie the Love Bug, and Jay Leno’s garage. I’ve been obsessed with cars since I was about 6.

However, I now realize that I was more based as a 5 year old watching Thomas the Tank Engine and Geotracks. Trains and buses are far better for humanity than cars.

Edit: we should’ve stuck with Buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation. They are far better than cars in almost every conceivable way.

Edit 2: just an FYI, I’ve lived in a rural community for my entire upbringing. Don’t come telling me I don’t know what it’s like walking or biking long distances.


Final Edit: 

Wow! I did not expect this to get so much attention. I guess I’ll say thanks or something? I’m not too familiar with this sort of thing.

Anyway, I guess I could make my stance clearer on this subject. I definitely think cars (and private transportation generally, have damaged our way of living, and I’m still in favor of minimizing their presence as much as possible. Even in rural communities, I think restructuring and proper planning can go a long way.

With that being said, I’m not an absolutist, and I know a topic this big has many complexities. Cars definitely have their place in society **EDIT (this obviously includes utility vehicles where necessary),** but I don’t think they’re as big a necessity as people say. That’s more or less my actual take.

This post was somewhat facetious (the whole Thomas the Tank Engine thing sort of shows that), and I suppose I didn’t make it with enough forethought. It was one of those “eh fuck it” sort of things. Had I known it would make the front page, I would’ve been a bit more nuanced with my take from the beginning. I also would’ve been a bit less hot-headed lol.

Even so, I got a lot of feedback on my opinion which changed my perspective a bit. In spite of a few rude comments here and there, I still appreciate everyone for contributing!

Anyway, hope y’all have a wonderful, night, day, morning, afternoon, or evening. Stay cool.",1652185244.0,Apprehensive_Bag2755,True,False,False,0.6

Every single person laughing at NFTs today will be using them in 10 years,1823,scf6bb,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/scf6bb/every_single_person_laughing_at_nfts_today_will/,3021,"NFTs are probably the most hated thing on the internet right now. I can understand why : stupid apes jpegs and the ""crypto-bro"" subculture is kinda annoying.

But here is what a lot of people need to understand : NFTs are much, much more than jpegs. **It's a piece of technology that has the potential to revolutionize a lot of things in our daily digital lives.**

Let me illustrate my point. Last week, there was an ETH hackaton organized by ETHglobal. In two days, participants created 255 different projects related to NFTs. Here's some very interesting projects that have nothing to do with ""stupid jpegs"" :

* Creativerse, a Minecraft server connected to Ethereum where lands and buildings are turned into NFTs - that means that nobody can censor you. 
* 0xPhotos, a stock photography marketplace that enable creators to get royalties everytime their photo is used. 
* veNFT, a DeFi projects that gives rewards to owners willing to stake their NFT. 
* ENS-Signature, which aim to integrate Ethereum Universal Sign-In into official documents such as DocuSigns. 

I think I've made my point : we are in the very early stages of a groundbreaking technology going mainstream. In ten years, those of us who choose to invest in this sector will be called ""lucky"" by the very same people that are laughing at NFTs right now.

Keep your mind open. Don't believe the lies ignorant people are telling you. DYOR, and you will see a lot of opportunities. **NFTs will be everywhere in our digital lives in less than a decade.**

(I'd like to give credit to Twitter user CroissantETH for opening my eyes about this subject. The projects listed above are from one of his thread.)

"How I Built A Healthy Service Business That's Doing $100,000 Per Month Net Profit",64,vmk3gv,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/vmk3gv/how_i_built_a_healthy_service_business_thats/,135,"If you want to build a successful company, everything will depend on your team and company culture.. I’ve created a company culture that starts from the founder level (me) down to every single employee – and what’s important is that everyone is the right fit.

When you’re building a team to grow your business, it will ultimately come down to this: There is no good or bad hire - simply culture misfit or perfect fit.

I’ve always focused on attracting Top 1% talent in their roles YET fit my company culture… You want to make sure that you only have a team that resonates with your culture… that’s the only way to retain top 1% talent.

**Here are my 5 Laws on how I went from 0 → $100,000 per month profit from my direct marketing company.**

So here we go…

None of it was easy… nothing of long-term significance is ever easy, nor will it ever be.

Entrepreneurship is difficult. 

It is – in my opinion – the MOST difficult thing ever. Every entrepreneur gets into the game for their own reasons. There are a multitude of reasons for why every individual entrepreneur starts a business.

Some just don’t want a 9-5 anymore, some want to change the world, and create a huge impact in their market.

In interest of full disclosure and transparency, my “WHY” was something else: I was afraid of poverty.

  
**The Origins:**

Growing up I experienced a rather financially tumultuous childhood. 

My father went from being a celebrated sales manager for HP (making a comfortable living for our family), to starting his own business and losing EVERYTHING by the time my brother and I were in our teens.

We were enrolled into private schools where our friends came from money… and by the time we graduated from high school, my brother and I were the poorest kids - and we were most definitely made to feel so.

My parents split up, we could barely afford to eat food twice a day… and it's just not the life I wanted to live.

I experienced deep emotional pain when I’d see my father work excruciatingly long hours just to make ends meet - and we’d barely get by.

I felt intense humiliation that came from being so broke that my parents had to seek financial help from their siblings (my uncles) just so we could have food on the table.

I felt extremely unworthy, extremely poor… 

… and experienced profound sadness during my late teens - more so because I didn’t want to see my parents unhappy and miserable.

I became scared of poverty.

But I also promised myself that no matter what happens, I will rise above this. For myself and for my family.

  
**My First Business FAILED Miserably:**

I worked in hospitality for 1.8 years and saved approximately $20,500 in that time. 

I had an idea for a business. Marketplaces were coming up in the early 2010s and I had an idea to build my own marketplace.

Without any formal education in business, management or marketing, I ventured into the world of entrepreneurship with both feet, and my hard earned $20.5k.

In hindsight, I over spent money on things that made absolutely no sense. I had 0 idea about online marketing, I overpaid “marketing professionals” and saw 0 revenue back…

But with my back against the wall, I had to learn how to onboard users WITHOUT any money… 

So I worked and studied round the clock. I studied marketing to the core.  I learned SEO, copywriting, cold outbound email strategies, back linking -  you name it.

In 4 years I was able to grow that marketplace to 10,000 customers and 1200+ vendors… but it failed.

In my 3rd year in business I’d raised money from investors but I didn’t know how to build an organization. My management was poor. Ultimately everybody quit the company. I had immense overheads, we weren’t even breaking even.

I used to read articles of how internet entrepreneurs were making $10k a month and living the digital nomad life - traveling the world.

Here I was making over $10k/mo in revenue YET I was losing more money than that on operations and marketing… I was extremely stressed and had no idea how to make it work.

Ultimately the whole thing came crashing down, nobody wanted to invest in it any further.

I’d entered my late 20s by then, and I was dead broke. Not the life I wanted to have. All my friends around me had stable jobs, wives, lived comfortably - while I couldn’t afford to do even the most basic things without thinking twice.

There was consolation in listening to business coaches on Youtube talk about how such is the life of an entrepreneur. 

“You just needed to hit once to be set for life.” I would hear people like Mark Cuban say.

However, when you’re nearing your 30s, you have no money and you’re sleeping on your mom’s couch - you best believe you’ve mentally hit the lowest of lows (especially if you’re ambitious).

But you have to keep going… My father was my biggest inspiration at this point. He had kept pushing, kept persevering… relentless - and he became financially successful again.

*“I am young”*, I said to myself… *“If he can do it, I have literally no excuse.”*

  
**And then things changed…**

And things changed when reality hit me hard. The reality was this: **Business is for profit.**

Everything I was doing before was okay… but the *real reason* I wasn’t getting rich was because I didn’t focus on profit.

And by that I mean, laser sharp focus on profit.

By not focusing on profit, I was focusing on everything else. And this is where the majority of young entrepreneurs go wrong.

When you’re not focused on profit, you’re not focused on money. The biggest problem with money is, it is very elusive.

It is VERY easy to spend money, but very very difficult to earn money.

To understand this, you need to understand the **energy principles** of money.

→ Spending money requires almost no energy  
→ Earning money requires A LOT of energy.

There are 2 types of energies: Mental & Physical.

  
**Do this exercise now:**

Just close your eyes for 60 seconds and visualize yourself spending money. Think of everything you want to buy, and then literally visualize yourself buying it.

Now think about how much physical and mental energy you spent actually buying those things?

Not a lot right?

Whether you bought a car, a nice dinner, an expensive watch, your dream home… All it takes is looking at what you want, and either swiping your card or writing a check - what else really is there when you spend?

Now do the math - how much did you spend? $10k? $50k? 100k… 500k.. 1M?

Whatever you spent… hold that figure in your mind.

Now just close your eyes for 60 seconds again, and visualize yourself EARNING that money…

How much energy does it take to make it? Customers… sales… marketing… operations… outreach… emails… social media… team management… etc. etc.

You see what I mean? **It’s a LOT harder to earn money.** It requires a lot more energy.

Yet… as entrepreneurs we are so consumed with spending before earning. This mindset is what sunk my last business to the bottom..

Taking control of this mindset and acting accordingly is what helped my next business do over a million a year in profit.

  
**That’s why I want to talk about HOW to focus on earning money effectively.**

Earning a lot of money is hard… but not impossible.

There is a science to making a lot of money… In science there are laws. In economics there are laws. If you follow the science - you will make a lot of money. But you need discipline.

There are 5 LAWS that can make you rich in the 6-12 months.

These are the same laws that make companies grow fast.

These are the same laws that took me from broke to rich… and these are the same laws that will help you make a lot of money too.

Our goal is to reduce the energy expended on earning money, and scale fast, and make a lot of money.

So let’s dive into them.  


**Law #1 Acquire a Problem Solving/Pain Relieving SKILL:**

Do you know why a neurosurgeon makes a helluva lot more money than the average physician?

Do you know why Uber is valued at $44Bn?

Do you know why Google dominates the internet?

In all of these examples, these guys solve a big problem. 

A neurosurgeon literally saves your brain… Uber helps you get cabs so you don't have to stand on the side of the road waiting endlessly for a taxi… Google gives you access to whatever information you need on the planet within 1 second…

Here’s a fact: The bigger and more painful a problem you can solve, the more clients you will get and the more money you will make.

Solving big problems also requires big skill sets…

The neurosurgeon is highly skilled in medical science… Uber and Google’s founders and engineers are highly skilled in math and computers.

They first acquired highly sophisticated skill sets, then they used their skill set to HELP people solve big problems, and relieve them off their pain.

Remember, the quicker and more efficiently you can move people from pain to pleasure, the MORE money you will make and the more clients you will get.

But it is important to note that you want to solve big problems. The problem should be big, the pain should be really painful… there should be a lot of worries, fears, anxieties related to that pain. When you use your skill to solve a deep rooted painful problem, you will make a lot of money.

  
**Law #2 Turn That Skill Into ONE Productized Offer:**

Once you have a sophisticated skill, you need to turn that skill into money - this is where most experts don’t know what to do next, and they undersell themselves in the market.

The way to fix this is by creating a “productized offer” around your skill set and building a business around that offer.

Your business needs only ONE offer that you can repeatedly sell to thousands of customers. But the problem with most entrepreneurs is that their offer is “customized” for their clients.

That’s a problem. If you’re going to customize your offer for every customer you get, you’re not going to be able to scale. You need to “templatize” your offer.

I struggled with this for a very long time…

But once my mentors taught me how to niche down, how to create 1 solution for 1 market… the money started pouring in.

… it became easier to manage operations

… fulfillment became a breeze

… client success numbers shot up

… and I finally had a proper business.

You need to take your skill and package it in a way where it can help millions of people - that total packaging becomes your offer. You then put a price on that offer and build an entire company around it - that becomes your business.

  
**Law #3 Operate In a Wealthy Market:**

Now that you have an offer that can help people solve big problems… you need to actually sell it to people to make money.

The FASTEST way to make a lot of money is by selling to rich people. Rich people have money, they have access to money, they want to spend money to advance faster.

You cannot make money in a market that is broke. It is very very difficult to sell to people that don’t have money.

Selling to people that have no money and have no access to money either is a massive waste of time. You will never scale, you will have to expend too much energy on marketing and sales… and that is the antithesis of building a profitable business.

In my first business this was another problem due to which my business failed. I was selling to people that had no money.

And because they had no money, even though they needed my service, they could not justify the expense.

This is the biggest secret… If your customer can easily justify the expense, you will have no problem selling. Money only comes from sales.

You want to do whatever you can to make sure that there’s as little burden on your sales process as possible - because the more you sell the more money you’ll make.

So you want to make your sales process as frictionless as possible - and no better way to make it frictionless by selling to people who already have the money ready to invest in your services.

  
**Law #4 Get FREE + PAID Attention From Your Market:**

The next step is to get attention from your market.

You know you need to sell to rich people, now you need to get their attention. Attention is the most scarce resource on this planet today.

Because of social media apps everyone's mind is distracted. They want to scroll to the next thing…

There is also a lot of content and a lot of ads… therefore there is a lot of competition.

You need to grab attention in a crowded market. The attention should be so strong that you have all eyes on you.

This kind of attention can be very easily acquired but it requires specialized marketing knowledge and skills (which I will talk about later in this post)...

But you need to understand that there are 2 types of attention: Free & Paid.

Free attention comes from people talking about you, people referring to you, your social media presence, your features in news and media articles.

Paid attention comes from ads.. That’s called buying attention through media. So it’s commonly known as “Media Buying”. You must’ve heard this term for sure.

You can also pay influencers who already have an healthy relationship with their own audience, to talk about your product and service - this way you can “buy” the attention of their followers.

You need a healthy mix of Free + Paid attention for one and one thing only: **To build your own audience.**

And what I mean by “your own audience” is… a large group of people in your market that have paid attention to you through free and paid efforts.

**This can be in the form of**: email lists, blog subscribers and buyers who bought from you (existing customers).

Once you have their attention, or better yet once you’ve sold them something or given them a free trial, they are now readily available to pay attention to you, whenever you show up.

The warmer they are to you, the MORE you can sell to them.

The warmer they are to you, the less friction you will encounter in sales.

  
**Law #5 Direct Response Conversions + Branding:**

There are 2 types of people who buy…

1. There are people who buy on brand value and logic
2. There are people who buy on gut instinct and emotion

Therefore there are two types of marketing: Branding and Direct Response.

You need a healthy mix of both!

Branding costs a lot of money. You usually see this in the form of large billboards, TV Ads, celebrity endorsements, logos, brand value, 7-figure marketing campaigns…

Direct response costs 0. You can literally build a multi-million dollar company based on direct response marketing alone.

But you need a healthy mix of both.

But that doesn’t mean you need to spend a lot of money on branding. The basic idea of branding is that when people look at your brand, they should feel like they’re working with a trustworthy brand.

There are a lot of psychological triggers that go into that… but you want to make sure that you have a well made website that is authentic to your mission and purpose AS WELL AS is relatable to your target market.

On the other hand, direct response is all about emotional marketing conversions.

If your company has a good balance of direct response marketing and branding, you revenue will take off like a rocket ship!

  
**If I had to sum it up… there are only 2 skills I mastered to get my and my company to $100k/month in net profits:**

1. Marketing
2. Sales

If you can master these two skills… you will practically never have a money problem ever.

I want to help you define what marketing and sales are.

**Marketing, is the effort that brings you attention and leads**

**Sales, is the effort that converts that attention into money**

A lot of people are confused about this, but I hope that now it is clear… and that you have to be good at both!

Especially if you are a solo entrepreneur starting from scratching trying to make your first million.

  
**Final words....**

If I can end this post with ONE valuable skill set… that I would highly encourage you to learn - it would be **copywriting**.

If you can master the craft of copywriting it will really help you grow your business fast. Copywriting is very important because words move people.

If you can use your words to uplift people's emotional state, they will buy from you.

Ultimately, like I said earlier. Business is for profit. That should be your #1 priority. It all starts with that mindset.

Spend less than you make, and constantly push yourself to make more, sell more, get more clients and customers.

If you can price your offers properly, you’ll only need 40-50 clients to get to $1.2M per year.

But you have to remember: Business is for profit.",1656412458.0,whitespadex,True,False,False,0.52

Additional Upcoming Changes,0,xcwd7g,pathofexile,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/xcwd7g/additional_upcoming_changes/,2220,"In an upcoming patch, we'll be making some further small changes to the Lake of Kalandra expansion. This news post outlines what you can expect.   
  
In a previous post, we mentioned we were discussing issues related to magic find/culling feeling mandatory as well as cases where it feels bad to get a lot of quality currency or flasks from killing a monster with specific Archnemesis modifiers. In both of these cases, our discussions are ongoing. However, in order to provide a bit more certainty, we can say that we don't have easy solutions for these issues mid-league and will be looking at what's possible for 3.20. 
  
**Upcoming Changes**  
We're planning to remove Gems as a possible reward from Tier 3 and 4 generic encounters in the Lake of Kalandra. For the most part, these will be replaced by Currency Chests.

We're planning to reduce the number of monsters that spawn in the Reflection of the Dream encounter. Additionally, we're planning to reduce the open and close time of the Breach. This is both for reasons related to performance and the difficulty level of the encounter. 

We are lowering the duration of the shocked ground on death from the Electrocuting archnemesis mod from 25 seconds to 10 seconds.

  
We are also removing the damage from Permafrost's cold-damaging ground area. The area only applies chill now.


We are lowering the duration of Incendiary's fire-damaging ground area from 4 seconds to around 3 seconds.

We're increasing the cooldown of the Ice Prison Archnemesis mod from 5 seconds to 10 seconds. The duration of the Ice Prison is being increased from 3 seconds to 5 seconds. This results in 50% prison uptime rather than 60%, and fewer overall prisons.

For magic monsters only: we're disabling on-death ground effects for the Incendiary modifier. We're also disabling volatiles from spawning on death when a monster with the Toxic modifier is slain. 

Flasks will be able to have Fractured modifiers, which can be obtained through the Empowered Elements conversion modifier.

We're planning to increase the chances for the Will of Chaos and Deadly End Ultimatum Aspects to drop from their relevant bosses.

We have a small patch coming out in the next couple of days with some very minor fixes, most of which is unrelated to the above changes. We'll get this set of changes out as soon as we can.",1663038603.0,Bex_GGG,True,False,False,0.43

The thing is, with how big of an overhaul the league is with a focus on uniques, I'm certain that grinding gear games will want to make *those uniques in particular* accessible to the common player so that we can actually experience and have **FUN** with the changes being put into this patch.

I know they've said that globally uniques will drop less, but I honestly think that's just because they want you to get a few less araku tikis per league. The uniques you actually want - I'm sure those will be accessible.

After the Expedition league incident, there's no way Grinding Gear would risk putting out content that players would find highly frustrating and I think recent leagues have been evidence of a paradigmatic shift in GGG's *modus operandi*. The idea of hyping up all these uniques and then making them impossible to get is only something a really really malicious developer would do; and honestly, we have the best devs of any game.

Things are looking bleak with how much AGS is focusing on milking profits,38,tatvye,lostarkgame,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostarkgame/comments/tatvye/things_are_looking_bleak_with_how_much_ags_is/,496,"Some of the things that have happened recently are very concerning.

&nbsp;

**Argos & 1370 ilv**

* No other version has had any T3 content released where you couldn't very easily reach the beginning ilv f2p on release. I asked around and was specifically told this never happened by a few people (including Saintone) except for in a few instances where later phases of a raid were just gated by needing to get gear progression from the earlier phases of that same raid.
* Both KR and RU got honing changes *with the Argos release* (not the 20% flat rate ones though, more minor ones)
* Both KR and RU had significantly more time to do things before the release of Argos
* Both KR and RU had content (Challenge Guardians, Abyss Trial, PvP vendor) that we don't even have in the game that rewards a large amount of honing materials

Due to all of this, it seems like we are intentionally being starved of materials and put in a spot where it is VERY rough to hit 1370 without swiping in order to get people to swipe due to FOMO.

And I assume this trend is going to continue, more and more raids released further and further out of reach of non-whales.

&nbsp;

**New Skin**

Apparently this new skin is a skin from the beta of LA that everyone got to try out for free and ended up being one of the worst selling skins ever on actual release because everyone had already used it in the beta.

It seems like they might intentionally just be releasing poorly performing skins to get people to buy them since they are the only option.

&nbsp;

**Bots**

Amazon has had a very lacklustre response to botting. It's still rampant and unchecked. The economy of every server is in shambles.

The issue here is I think Amazon actually has a profit incentive to not really fix this problem, and since they seem to be focused on profits in other areas over the player experience I imagine they might just not do much at all about bots, which will totally fuck the game in the long run.

Basically bots drive the price of crystals up, and massively dillute the buying power of gold players earn from normal gameplay (like abyss rewards). This means that over time it will be more and more effective to swipe for gold/crystals, something Amazon wants.",1646899459.0,Kaelran,True,False,False,0.52

"Even If The Transphobia Doesn't Bother You, Please Don't Buy (or Even play) The New Hogwarts Game",15742,x0n0fn,WitchesVsPatriarchy,https://www.reddit.com/r/WitchesVsPatriarchy/comments/x0n0fn/even_if_the_transphobia_doesnt_bother_you_please/,1371,"Stole the following from FB, and it's a pretty good commentary on why you shouldn't buy, or even play the upcoming JKR Hogwarts game

So let me get this straight. There's a new, very polished video game set in the Wizarding World of committed transphobe JK Rowling. The plot of the game is that there is a rebellion of goblins who are fighting against racial discrimination and prejudice by the Ministry of Magic and the wizarding community as a whole. From the Harry Potter Compendium - ""The Goblin Rebellions were a series of rebellions in which the goblin population of the Wizarding world revolted against discrimination and prejudice toward their kind by wizards and witches. They were most prevalent during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but even in modern times there are subversive goblin groups working in secret against the Ministry of Magic, according to the Daily Prophet. The historical rebellions have been described as ""bloody and vicious."" ...These rebellions may have occurred because of lack of goblin representation [in magical Parliament], attempts to enslave goblins as house-elves, stripping of wand privileges, wizard attempts to control Gringotts, or the brutal goblin slayings by Yardley Platt.""

And you, the hero, are a wizard whose ultimate task it is to quash the rebellion and put these goblins back in their rightful place under the rule of the wizards.

The goblins of the HP series have long been criticized as offensive Jewish stereotypes, with critics pointing out their control of the magical banking system, their greed, and their exaggerated facial features. And the game is set in 1890, around the time the antisemitic hoax ""Protocols of the Elders of Zion"" was being developed (published 1903 amidst a new wave of antisemitism in Europe). Part of the official gameplay reveal shows the two villains, Ranrok the goblin (pictured) and Victor Rookwood the dark wizard, discussing what appears to be a child abduction scheme. From a fandom site: ""Ranrok was a very greedy individual who sought to claim a magical power he caught a glimpse of that wizardkind hid even from themselves. His worldview was skewed by his hatred for all wizards and witches, who he sought to destroy entirely.""

The lead designer for Avalanche Games, Troy Leavitt, has been a harsh critic of social justice movements, was a proponent of Gamergate, called the MeToo movement a ""moral panic,"" and claimed that society gives deferential treatment to LGBTQ+, POC, women, and disabled people. And Warner Brothers knew this before they hired him to make this game. This game where the player fights against greedy, child-abducting Jewish stereotypes. The game where the player suppresses an uprising of an oppressed race who are pushing back against their own disenfranchisement, disarmament, slavery, and murder, in order to maintain the supremacy of the dominant culture.

Um...

WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS THIS NONSENSE?

Listen, friends. I know a lot of you still love the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. You've got a lot of emotional baggage tied up in whether you're a member of House Braggadocio, House GiftedChild, House SamwiseGamgee, or House EugenicsAreGoodActually. But I beg you, please, don't buy this game. Walk away from both Rowling and the Wizarding World. Don't give Warner Brothers any more money.""

Direct Evidence of Social Manipulation: Anti-crypto groups are infiltrating this subreddit in an attempt to make crypto unstable,15,uu2lfa,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uu2lfa/direct_evidence_of_social_manipulation_anticrypto/,350,"FUD: *“fear, uncertainty and doubt, usually evoked intentionally in order to put a competitor at a disadvantage.”* FUD plays on our naivety and fears, and is a form of social manipulation, plain and simple.

We know there’s a coordinated effort by anti-crypto groups attempting to destroy cryptocurrency.  They’re attempting to do so by posting negative content in hopes of sowing fear and distrust.  Many of these groups, such as r/buttcoin (see Forbes article: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2021/06/26/reddit-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-social-media/?sh=12b81d16621f](https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2021/06/26/reddit-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-social-media/?sh=12b81d16621f), operate right here in the open on Reddit.  

Members of these groups attack crypto by going for the jugular, for example by attacking the integrity of USDT.  Their arguments against USDT are ridiculous, circular and speculative, but to the uninformed may sound like valid concerns.  

They believe attacking USDT with FUD will cause the collapse of the entire crypto market.  Their FUD however is not limited to USDT.  You can often spot these bad actors by checking their post and comment history to get a general idea of their sentiment towards cryptocurrency.  Always check someone’s post and comment history.  If you see they’re using a new account with little karma *and* have a negative sentiment towards crypto, this is a red flag they may have bad intentions.  

I believe we should aggressively call these people out and downvote their posts and comments.  Often, they will hide behind phrases such as “this isn’t FUD, the community needs to discuss these things,” or “I’m asking a valid question/I have a valid concern, that’s not FUD”.  Sure, there are some who really do have valid questions or concerns, but many are working in coordinated groups to try and destroy cryptocurrency, and we must be vigilant.  

We must come together as a group to denounce those that are here with bad intentions.

If you’re in support of cryptocurrency as a whole let’s try and view every negative post and comment with a skeptics eye.  Do not be afraid to review someone’s past post and comment history, and be vocal about questioning someone’s intentions if need be. We must not allow ourselves to be intimidated by those who act aggressively towards undermining crypto’s integrity.",1653066836.0,R0B0TPARTY,True,False,False,0.51

#Why do we need a megathread?
Due to the speed that some topics evolve within the community, it can be difficult for people to keep up with relevant information or find what is new or old. To assist with this, a megathread is created to consolidate all related information to a single thread for easier discussion and location.

#How does this megathread work?

People may submit related clips and tweets to LSF so the bot automatically links the submissions on the megathread, or contact the mods to add related content to the megathread. If you choose to submit, your post will be automatically linked on the megathread and removed to avoid clutter on the front page.

Anyone else put off by the heterosexual agenda in The Last Of Us 2?,48656,s4r2rr,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/s4r2rr/anyone_else_put_off_by_the_heterosexual_agenda_in/,5697,"I finished The Last of Us Part II over the weekend. It was fine, but some aspects of it really rubbed me the wrong way. I just don't understand what narrative purpose it served for Tommy and Maria to be a married couple. They talk about their marriage and how they seperate at the end. It was really off-putting because it felt like they were forcing it down my throat. What was the reason why they had to be together? To score brownie points for straights?

I tried to brush it aside but then we get introduced to Abby. Its clear very early on that she has romantic feelings for Owen. More straights?! And then, the two have a sex scene. It's very in your face and it just screams agenda. It seemed like Naughty Dog just wanted to appease the straight community instead of focusing on the story.

They were some natural and organic characters in the game like Ellie, Lev, and Dina (who had a male partner in the past). But they just had to ruin it by forcing an agenda. I don't have a problem with straight people (my landlord is straight), but I do have a problem with them having to be in everything. I was playing this with my seven year old, and after a couple of murders, dog stabbings, and blowing off people's heads, I had to take him out of the room when Owen and Mel kissed. It's just ridiculous we can't have family friendly entertainment anymore.

Overall, do better Naughty Dog.

so far in LA, Westbrook is finishing the same exact 58.8% of his shots from 0-3 feet and 35% of his FGA are at the rim

in his MVP season in 16-17, he shot 57.6% from 0-3 feet with 29.3% of his FGA were at the rim

the popular narrative seems to be that Westbrook declined severely as a finisher because his athleticism fell off. yet he's finishing at the rim at exactly the same rate when he spent his prime with KD in OKC

You are showing absolutely zero appreciation of the fact that there is actually something substantial being done with the Legendarium and that now more than ever will people watch LOTR content that isn't just the original trilogy.
2. I understand the frustration at not getting a 100% faithful adaptation of the Silmarillion, but this frustration is totally irrational. There is no other timeline where this happens. It is impossible. There is no such thing as a show that is 100% faithful to its adapted novel, ESPECIALLY the most expensive show ever made.
3. Completely unacceptable backlash at casting choices. Again, I get it, they aren't canon, but the fact that your criticism extends beyond just a simple observation just makes people think you're racist. I'm sorry, I really dont care if you think you aren't racist, the fact that a black Elf and a black Dwarf bothers you so much makes you look insecure, not righteous. This is how other people perceive you and the LOTR fandom, and if you do not want to be perceived as racist then maybe you can calm the fuck down and stop whining. Do you have any idea how many of my friends saw posts that called LOTR fans racist?
4. You need to stop watching sensationalist YouTube channels that make it their full-time job to bash Rings of Power. They don't care about Tolkien, they only care about you angrily clicking on their video so they can make ad money.
5. Finally, you have perverted Tolkien's work by gatekeeping it. The Legendarium is about good triumphing over hate, about all free people working together as a force of good to defeat the ultimate bad. And most importantly, how overcoming this evil is by being able to change and adapt. You people have only demonstrated you ability to hate while also your inability to change.
6. **After reading responses, I understand the anti-corporatist sentiment and the nature of ""just consume and be happy"" mentality, but you all are taking it to a personal level. Contrary to popular belief, this account was not bought by Amazon, though I'm glad that you think that I got money from them because I wish I did. Honestly it's because I'm tired of calling myself a fan of this Legendarium where there are so many people that are clearly upset with the mainstreaming of their story. I'll admit, is it ideal? No, it isn't. But YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE TV SERIES EVER MADE. Of course there is going to be vast corporate interests in it and of course there is going to be a good amount of editing to make sure it appeals to PEOPLE OTHER THAN DIE-HARD LOTR FANS. This show is not meant to attract the few, it is meant to attract the many, and if you can't deal with that, fine go ahead and be bitter, but the purpose of this post is for me to vent about having to be associated with people who clearly have way too much time on their hands to care about anything else.** 

**If you're wondering, yes, I am happy that something is being done with the franchise, and I'm happy that people will, now more than ever, be talking about LOTR. And I'm happy that I can address any questions from people I know who will watch it and wonder how it happened in the books, because like most people, I understand that there is no way in hell that any production company (including the Tolkien Estate) would have allowed a 100% faithful adaptation to Tolkien's works without creative licensing.** 

This will get deleted, but some of you need a reality check on this series. Right now, all you're accomplishing is defecating on Tolkien's legacy. From now on, when people think of Tolkien, they won't think of high fantasy, they'll think of his racist fans who despise diversity and think that change is impossible.",1658105042.0,ComradeMaethor,True,False,False,0.55

What is happening is that his main account was shadow flagged as a smurf for going from 8k to 11k in a short period of time by valve's algorithm.

He has already tried to solve the problem but he has been ignored by valve. This is his job and his livelihood and the fact that he is now unfairly unable to play on his account has affected his career as a streamer. The amount of viewers has decreased as he now no longer plays against other high level players, unable to play on his main account he has resorted to using alternate accounts but these always end up in the smurf pool after a few days or weeks.

He has mentioned multiple times how discouraging is for him to play in those accounts and how all what he wants is to play in his main account again. So if you guys are really so unhappy about someone doing something wrong then ask valve to solve the problem with his main account so he can continue with his job.",1652939632.0,Motoe2,True,False,False,0.51

All credit to Tennessee they are a great team and outplayed our defense. But this game felt very sus. They reviewed a targeting call on Bryce that was clear as day and called it wrong. They attempted to give Tennessee 5 downs. They blew the Whistle as the Tennessee RB was getting stripped. Our receiver got pulled down by the face mask directly in front of a ref who must be blind. The holding calls were not called both ways at all. If your gonna be that strict with us about holding then you better make it even. Then at the end of the game when it mattered most they call pass interference on a jump ball. I’m not even sure they threw the flag until they saw we intercepted it.  Not to mention did you see how many times they had to huddle up and discuss shi, was very weird. I understand my opinion is bias because I’m a fan but it actually felt like we were being set up. These are some of the best players in the country on our team and your telling me they are that inexperienced and getting penalized this much. The PI calls are ridiculous. That PI at the end was a horrible call. That late in the game you don’t call that. We obviously had plenty of other opportunities but it’s a very big momentum killer when u make big plays and they call a flag for it every time. Everybody loves to say that this is revenge because we get all the calls but pls name another time where the team we played had 17 penalties.

Be a man and dress up for Mass,13,ut52qp,Catholicism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/ut52qp/be_a_man_and_dress_up_for_mass/,463,"Let me start off by saying no, clothes don't make the man, what's inside counts most.

Clothing is an exterior superficial aesthetic that doesn't necessarily reflect what a man's interior life is like. Dressing well however, doesn't make a person vain any more than dressing fashionably does, nor incessantly dressing casually does. Vanity is a separate issue from dressing well and I'm not sure why so many people conflate the two things together.

Looking back at previous generations, dressing well was a standard for pretty much everyone, even bums wore tattered suits. 

Wearing a suit to Mass ought to simply be a cultural standard. Jesus Christ is the most significant person you will ever encounter and frankly if you have the means, wearing a sweatshirt and jeans, or t-shirt and shorts to Mass is just not good enough. Mass is heaven on earth, why wouldn't you dress up for it?

Many people nowadays says that how you dress doesn't matter, ironically though, making such a claim just proves the point further that having a preference for clothes really is important. If it truly didn't matter, why prefer a t-shirt over a button-down shirt?

So why dress up you ask?

Simply put, respect.

Modern fashion is extremely vulgar and  decadent. It's all about showing off and peacocking, flashing your brand names, expressing yourself with words, pictures, and symbols that don't actually mean anything.

It is much better to express yourself with patterns, colors, fabrics, and proper fit; using nuances and refinement rather than vulgar logos, brand names, and flashy lettering. Today's fashion is about showing off, classic style is exactly the opposite, it's about respect and refinement.

If truth, goodness, and beauty matter, then aesthetics matter.

&#x200B;

It is becoming ever more clear that FTD close outs are being driven to other tickers using the systemic smokescreen of DTCC's blackbody departments, such as the obligations warehouse, where these transactions are made and kept in secret.

GameStop's failures to deliver shares [are becoming egregious again.](https://chartexchange.com/symbol/nyse-gme/failure-to-deliver/?shr_d=YkRV3Y) About 2 Million newly-created FTDs (guaranteed to be GameStop-specific fails) over the updated reported period, updated today.  On 27 July, 2022, we can see about $43,000,000.00 worth of FTDs were 'closed out' in some way.  Remember that [Reg SHO allows entities to close out 'meme stock' FTDs by purchasing like-kind 'meme stock' securities](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/wcdffn/presqueeze_gme_condition_now_verified_saturdays/).  This explains MSM's push to identify these newly-forged chinese scam tickers into the same 'meme stock' bin as GameStop.

[We are seeing MSM focus on this word 'loop' a lot now](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meme-stocks-are-a-self-containing-loop-market-strategist-explains-173704453.html) to describe meme stocks.  Why that word?  Something is up.  We do know that Loop Capital underwrote this one:

&#x200B;

[Looking at GME's updated FTD data, HKD was used as a like-kind 'meme stock' FTD-close out, as it was predominantly pumped on the same day that a $43 Million worth of GME FTD's needed to be closed out.  Although GameStop went from $32.00 to $34.00 that day, this scam chinese ticker that Loop Capital underwrote jumped from $49.00 to $80.00 that day.  This suggests that these tickers are being used as insider trades AND FTD-driven closeouts.  They are cycling FTDs into their own inside scams to stay afloat.  Also note that there is NO requirement in Reg SHO for a fund to do anything with an 'FTD close out' \(and in this case, a purchase of the chinese ticker\) after it is already completed.  Hence the following Dump, because they can just sell it at a high and then not circle back to the GME-specific FTD list.  This is part of the black hole loop.](https://preview.redd.it/mhlba0f9wxh91.png?width=707&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1635f34070c37479e8b4b70c45800662684cce4)

&#x200B;

# The following material is similar to the above scenario, and to GameStop via the investment of GameStop Chairman Ryan Cohen into Bed Bath and Beyond.  Therefore, what happens with Bed Bath and Beyond does have a material impact on GameStop, by co-ownership.

Ryan Cohen adversary \[and GameStop short-seller\] Loop Capital's Anthony Chukumba [seems to now be having trouble breathing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQYqqU3eLZ8).  He has an irregular breathing pattern in this video, and it is clear to me he is actively in psychological duress.  He is now in panic.  He called for $1.00 for $BBBY, which is not going quite as planned, as [$BBBY is at $16.00 now](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBBY?p=BBBY&.tsrc=fin-srch), up from $4.00 a few weeks ago.  Yet, Ryan Cohen's [10% ownership in $BBBY also contains short-term options expiry for $BBBY for $60.00 to $80.00 exercise prices](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000886158/000119380522000426/sc13d13351002_03072022.htm).

In response to the invention of the '[magical](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/whjxvs/80m_to_4_billion_in_1_day_the_magic_of_crime_the/)' crime, and the newfound Melvin/Citron-like impending failure of Loop Capital and co, they seem to be advocating for this [ongoing chinese scam ticker](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MEGL?p=MEGL&.tsrc=fin-srch) to move in lockstep with $BBBY.  It could not be more obvious at this point what Loop Capital (and likely with Market Maker's assistance of inside orders, block orders, and lit exchange routing of buy volume).  This ticker is up on no news.  We know it's part of the crime, so let's analyze it:

&#x200B;

[BBBY and MEGL Correlation Longer Term - Pumping in lockstep for collateral, and perhaps using BBBY's own FTDs as insider trades to Hedge the Squeeze Using the Squeeze FTDs](https://preview.redd.it/p9yuir66zxh91.png?width=1161&format=png&auto=webp&s=511a3efc0d1ac36521017b58cb668bbd5c8d5a9b)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[BBBY and MEGL Correlation Medium Term - Pumping in lockstep for collateral, and perhaps using BBBY's own FTDs as insider trades to Hedge the Squeeze Using the Squeeze FTDs](https://preview.redd.it/2z07savi0yh91.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc6979fd28db9161e5537c673e3660aa4674c0f2)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[BBBY and MEGL Correlation Short Term - Pumping in lockstep for collateral, and perhaps using BBBY's own FTDs as insider trades to Hedge the Squeeze Using the Squeeze FTDs](https://preview.redd.it/b6zf5wah1yh91.png?width=1167&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3d6aacdbd1699f4d87109fa8ee327c89c156a99)

TLDR:

Loop Capital is not ironic in name:  their scam involves LOOPING FTDs from meme stocks into insider trades for hedging.  Insider-purchasing of newly-forged-chinese-scam tickers THAT THEY UNDERWRITE to *Loop* FTD-generated capital that they never then have to circle back on.  Get it?  LOOP CAPITAL.  Looping meme stock FTDs as purchases into THEIR UNDERWRITTEN TICKERS as collateral to hedge against MOASS.  This is the 'Loop' in their name.

You cannot make this up.  They're that stupid to name their fund after their criminal black-hole 'loop.'

GameStop FTDs show a huge FTD close out that looks like the money went to another ticker.  This makes sense, as there is no requirement for a fund to do anything to a GME-specific FTD-close-out after it is closed out.  Therefore, funds on 27JUL2022 routed $43 Million of GME-specifc FTD-close-outs to insider-buy like-kind \[and maliciously/newly forged HKD\] chinese tickers to HEDGE against GME and other stocks.  Further, MEGL seems to have been newly created to fight against BBBY: to serve as absorption for BBBY-specific FTDs, as there is now evidence in the chart movements to support this conclusion.  Thus, the Magical Crime of MEGL is Loop Capital's last straw of criminal hope, as Ryan Cohen's Bed Bath and Beyond looks to take out another GameStop short-seller.  Standby for fireworks this week.

It’s been about a year.

Our sex life started to die off about 6 months ago. I have lost attraction to him. I miss the adventurous person he used to be. I miss going on backpacking trips with him, taking long hikes, him being interesting and reading books and listening to informational podcasts and having interesting things to talk about. 

Now it’s just him sitting in front of the screen all day talking to a bunch of other people on Discord and in the game about the game. I look at him and just see someone frozen in time, content for life to pass him by.

He asked me about our sex life a little while ago, and I was honest with him: I’m just not attracted to the person he has become. I’m just not a “gamer girl” who thinks it’s sooo sexy that he knows who all the Lords of the Rings are or whatever. And there’s nothing wrong with being that person or anything but it’s just not who I am attracted to.

Obviously he was really hurt by this, but instead of doing anything about it, he’s doubling down and seems to play more. I think this is a pretty direct message that he is over the marriage and our relationship and is embracing this video gamer person. 

I’d tried to plan a hiking trip for us and he just said no thanks and that he would rather play his game.

That's right -- with the exception of the writings of the Professor published posthumously, nothing in the LotR franchise has actually been canon! Movies, games, now shows -- none of them can actually affect what was written by JRRT in his lifetime. What this means is that the new show -- get this -- is *not* actually canon, and never would have been!

In addition, not only can the show not affect canon, it also can't impact *any* previously made films! Neither of Peter Jackson's film trilogies will have to acknowledge what happens in TRoP. This is actually due to a little-known phenomena called time, which caused Jackson's films to be released before TRoP.

What this means is one of two things: if the show is good, we'll have something to look forward to for five seasons. If it's bad, we have the option of just not watching it because it won't affect anything! Unlike other prominent media franchises, like Star Wars or the Marvel Cinematic Universe, no new canon content is being made (and that which is being published was written before any prominent Tolkien adaptation), so any new media can be safely ignored.

It truly is wonderful how one can just choose not to engage in something they dislike, isn't it?

Edit: upon further reflection, my initial post can easily read as me asserting that the show is immune to criticism given its noncanonical nature. That's not a sentiment I meant to convey -- if a show is deserving of criticism it should be criticized. I'm sorry if my post seemed to reflect that point of view.

Movie theater’s deserve to go out of business,6884,x1wydc,unpopularopinion,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/x1wydc/movie_theaters_deserve_to_go_out_of_business/,2923,"In a modern society where 4k tv’s are semi affordable and you can purchase a movie for less than the price of two tickets movie theater’s have no place. Movies are not a social event, and if you want them to be social nobody wants to hear you talk over something they paid money for. 

Ever since i’d say 2013 ish large flatscreens have become increasingly more affordable and most everyone has at least one in their home, and a good and cheap surround sound system is comparable to theatre sound to me. Plus at home you have cheap popcorn, cheap drinks, and the ability to pause whenever you like. 

I dont see movie theaters as romantic, or even as a good date. There is no verbal interaction while watching a movie, at least none that i would welcome. 

So why do these theaters exist? In a time where land is growing ever more precious the ginormous warehouses and lots they sit on hoard space for affordable housing complexes and actual interactive venues. All while being a complete ripoff to their patrons. My local theater recently increased a medium bag of popcorn to $12 and added a charge for extra butter as well as $1.50 for a small package of seasoning. F that.

TL;DR: why go to movie theaters? What is the actual benefit other than the fact that hollywood is forcing you to for new releases. Boycott them and wait for the movie to go streaming or blue ray. Eventually they will crumble and make way for modern society.",1661899599.0,CLow48,True,False,False,0.6

I keep seeing posts from people complaining that homeless people aren't properly thankful when given a banana or a loaf of bread when they are panhandling.

If they are in need and are homeless then cash is the way to help. Nobody knows their needs better than the person with needs. Maybe they need money for a prescription or a hotel room or a new tent or any number of things.

It people don't want to give money, then it makes sense to ask ""can I give you food instead?"" 

If the answer is ""no thanks,"" then give nothing or give money.

The concern is always that the money will be used for drugs or alcohol, but why? If you want to give, then who are you to judge how it's used?

Also, if drugs or alcohol can provide a suffering human with a small amount of temporary respite in this world, what is wrong with that?

Edit: TIL that homeless people only ever always use money for drugs and food is the only thing they need to improve their lives

I'm sorry if I can't respond to your comment, but I hope you all consider the situation of people in desperate need with more compassion in the future.

The ""it gets good"" saying has basically two facets: people's impression of what's going on and reality. The people's impression is that the game has deep and interesting gameplay, but the developers maybe failed to painlessly introduce the player to all of the rules, maybe the UI is not very clear and tutorials are lacking, so you have to put more than usual effort at the beginning to learn the game. But *once you get through all of this*, and understand all the rules and intricacies and relations between the systems, you get to this sweet core, the actual flow of gameplay. And it's worth the hassle. Except that it's usually not what's going on here. 

**Sunk cost fallacy**

The effort you've put into something *adds* to the value of that thing. You played a game for 30 hours? Now the game is *worth* that 30 hours. Your 30 hours, to you. It's really, really, really hard to look at yourself in the mirror and say: ""*yes, I've wasted 30 hours based on a promise that was never fulfilled*"". It's an admission of failure. And when you paid full price for the game? Oh boy, now it's 30 hours *and* $60. 

You know why demo versions for AAA games basically died? Because studies (and reality) showed that demos are more likely to confirm people's negative assumptions rather than introduce positive ones. As a result, more people *don't* buy the game after playing a demo. Meanwhile people who paid upfront for the game are more likely to convince themselves to ""give it a second chance"" and continue playing, because they already committed something. ""Maybe it gets better down the road"". It doesn't - but the time you invested raises the value of the game in your perception, makes you focus on the positives and ignore negatives, and you end up convincing yourself that the game... is actually quite good. 

And then you go on trying to convince others.",1653342042.0,ned_poreyra,True,False,False,0.51

Wow this has blown up more than I anticipated. 

Let me clarify. If you can’t afford to buy something outright, you should not finance it. This logic applies to any consumer purchase other that a car loan or a business loan. Using debt as a tool to build credit buy making small purchases and paying off the card is a useful tool. In many ways.

I’m still going to make y’all mad though. Cars shouldn’t be financed and SHOULD NOT be purchased new. Always buy used.

If you placed a reservation before launch, here’s what you can expect:

1. On the evening of September 25th, you will receive an email notifying you that Project Killswitch is available for purchase.
2. Click the link.
3. You will be greeted with a locked purchase UI.
4. Unlock the UI using information provided in the email.
5. Buy whatever you want.
6. At checkout, your order total will be reduced by the $3 reservation you already paid for (i.e. a $3 reduction from the pricing detailed above).
7. Orders will be shipped FIFO (i.e. in the sequence they were received).

Assuming the iPhone 14 hasn’t totally jammed our fulfillment pipeline, you can expect your order to ship as soon as next-day. Again - it’s FIFO, so if you’re at the back of the line, it may be upwards of a week.

One of two scenarios will play out shortly after we launch Project Killswitch:

* A. We’ll run out of stock.
* B. We’ll have stock remaining and open up availability to the general public.

We've issued death threats to countless scientists in order to prevent Scenario A. Little do they know, opening up stock to the general public will inevitably lead to Scenario A.

Once we’ve sold out of this first batch, Project Killswitch will not restock until the end of 2022.

You’ll hear from us again on September 25th with one final update. Until then, we’ve got some scientist-shaped coffins to stock up on.

^(Also, if you were randomly selected to receive a pricing survey last night, thanks for your participation. It’s a useful sanity check we deploy on all new products to ensure consumer pricing expectations are aligned with our MSRP.)

You should ask instead, why do girls buy Chanel bags and why do boys buy Patek Philippe watches ? They could’ve bought several live cows,  pet crocodiles and a metric ton of brass plating for the price of a single luxury bag. You could commission a leather workshop to make an exact replica of any luxury leather bag in the market for 1/10th of the price. However, try asking asking your girlfriend, which one does she prefer for her Valentine’s gift, 1 original Chanel or 10 high quality copies of it from China ?

It doesn’t have to make financial sense because they are luxury brands and so are NFTs like CryptoPunk and BAYC that grants you access to VIP clubs. It’s the new digital bling, stop seeing it purely from an investment viewpoint / get rich quick scheme.

# TL;DR: NFTs are digital status symbols

Has hating WoW become a circle jerk?,153,rdvnq8,wow,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/rdvnq8/has_hating_wow_become_a_circle_jerk/,521,"To start of: I do think that developer team has made some bad decisions etc. and Blizzard as a company ain't the best. These things are arguably true and I don't say anything against it. What I am saying is there are still good things in the game. 

For example I think the recent Season of mastery system is a nice fresh thing in it's own way and I do look forward to see what they develop in the coming seasons. I've been casually enjoying SoM and hopefully gonna hit 60 soon.

Retail is still mechanically holding up amazingly well if you think how old the engine and the game in general is. For me the WoW combat system is superior to other MMORPG. It is very fluent and responsive even in PvP scenarios. 

Even though they have made bad decisions with the story lately I still love the world and lore. I've been playing Warcraft games for a long time and the world to me is unique and interesting. I love to take my time with the quests and enjoy the story they tell us. They have made the questing experience better along the years and not everything is ""Kill 30 boars and run 50 kilometers"". I do say still that the story telling could be better.

I understand that a lot of you guys don't agree with me. It makes me sad to read r/wow since I feel most of the stuff here is very toxic and negative and people love to praise all the negative stuff aka. circle jerk. It is to some extent deserved but it gives especially new players impression that the whole game is 100% carbage. There are still new players joining to the game who experience the game in a whole different way than you do. They actually enjoy the game and I just hope that not too many of them come here and read all the negativity and let it affect how they feel about the game.

Finally: My point isn't that you shouldn't criticize WoW or Blizzard. My point is that if you do criticize make sure you have a valid point or make sure the guy who is criticizing has a valid point and don't just blindly join something that might not actually even be true.",1639212559.0,TerryBirch,True,False,False,0.55

Go post generic memes in a different sub-reddit so we can fucking breathe in here again. Oh, and for the love of Jesus Tap-Dancing Christ, take your goddamn shill bots with you. Here’s some gain porn and a rundown on my main lithium plays over the last month for those of you who remember what this sub is supposed to be about.

My options plays have been primarily focused on LTHM, L.A.C., ALB, PLL, and most recently SQM. As documented on my July 26th post \[Link\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w820yu/hey\_retard\_take\_that\_fucking\_crayon\_out\_of\_your/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w820yu/hey_retard_take_that_fucking_crayon_out_of_your/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), I was holding ALB calls, LTHM calls, and L.A.C. calls at the time, along with a bunch of shares for those twice baked, long-term tendies. By closing bell on August 2nd, I was up about $12k, loving life and draggin my nuts around like I owned the place. Then, the ER for LTHM came along and gave me the ol' dick hammer and put my nuts in a vice. I lost all the options gains from the last week in minutes. Fuckin' options. But it was then, in my darkest hour of lamenting another retarded commodity play and nursing my pancake sack, that I remembered the words of my elders and bought that fuckin’ dip with some more LTHM Sept expiration calls and held on for the ride. And up we rode.

August 10-12 I did some profit taking and narrowed my positions to just some L.A.C. Nov calls and my shares of course. I got off a little too early, but better to be early than never as my Uncle Randy always told me. By August 16th I felt like things were running too hot, so I picked the lithium company I liked the least (PLL), and flipped the switch with some OTM Sept puts. Sure as shit, down she went. Sold those off piece by piece over the next few days for nice 2 - 3 baggers.

Most recently, I played some SQM calls after they missed their EPS by less than 3% and tanked (almost like I learned from the LTHM ER... that's a first). Anyone with a brain that's 69% retarded or less would have seen that even though they missed, they were still up 800+ percent YOY on EPS, so this was just a great fuckin’ buy opportunity. I bought Sept and Oct exp calls on the 18th after the ER crash… FUCK, too early. Kept crashing. But I was sure, so balls to the wall on the 19th baby; deep discounted OTM calls for Sept, Oct, and Dec. Leveraged up, used some of that cruel mistress margin. No sleep all weekend - feelings of excitement mixed with self-doubt - Sunday night anxiety on a whole other level. Then came Monday, then came Tuesday, then \*I\* came Wednesday. Made a month's salary in just my RH account alone in less than 3 days, so like an only half-idiot investor I took some profits and am now playin the rest on house money. 

Here are some green lines & numbers for you if you're not big on reading.

For those of you who made it this far: I think we are going to see ATH’s on most lithium stocks in the coming days/weeks, so I’m still in. Just google lithium spot prices and tell me that shit ain’t gearing up for a moon shot. Current options holdings are fifteen L.A.C. 11/18 $30C, ten SQM 9/16 $110C, two SQM 10/21 $120C, three SQM 12/16 $110C. My positions on shares remains largely unchanged. I am holding 900 total shares of Lithium Americas (500 in IRA, 400 in brokerages), 50 shares of Albemarle, 275 shares of Livent, 250 shares of Sigma, and 50 shares of Sociedad Quimica. I did make a few minor acquisitions with 1000 shares of Arena Minerals, 900 shares of Magnis Energy, and 150 shares of Nano One Materials as well.

I think he was hands down the worst person on this season, but I’ve never seen any other “villain” of the show have their name be changed over and over.

1.	How oblivious can she be? Early on in the pods Shake already showed his true colors, asking her the shoulder ride question. Literally every girl was disgusted by Shake early on. We even find out that Jarette and Nick even went out of their way to warn her. Yet she proceeded and it took her all the way until the altar to say no? ...Or did she just want to stay in the show for longer?  


  

2.	She’s two faced. Shaina has an IG post with her where Deepti comments  “a bond unlike any other”. Yet at the same time, Deepti is also close friends with Natalie.. two faced much? Any good friend would cut Shaina off out of respect for Natalie.  


  

3.	During reunion when Natalie cried, Deepti didn’t even make a single ATTEMPT to console Natalie and she was sitting RIGHT next to her. Nick was the only decent being to pat her shoulder. EDIT: Found proof in the comments that she put her hand on her leg off a random blog.  


  
Sure, Deepti doesn’t deserve Shake and she’s a beautiful goddess or whatever. I totally get that. Shake was an asshole. But I hate that Shake’s incident gets so overblown and becomes the scapegoat making watchers blind to other cast members’ faults, like this post + Shaina during the reunion for example.

G4ng states that from his (*as well as his division mates*) perspective the Super Tester player just happened to get into the same Random battle.  i.e., there was ***no*** beforehand coordination, ***nor*** was there any form of conspiracy to ""rig"" or ""game"" the system in order to give G4ng a high plane kill count or other rewards.

what the fuck are you guys doing that makes the game feel so bad for you? i'm playing a random homebrew non-crit elemental bow build and everything feels fine. did i just happen to dodge all of the new rare mods that brick builds? 

my only guess is that u guys were able to play at like 10x the speed i play at and now you can only do like 2x or something, meanwhile my playspeed went from 1x to 1x. for you it was a massive downgrade and for me everything feels about the same but more interesting since all the mods are new and the league mechanic is fun to toy with.

edit: I pretty much always listen to songs from their original singer, if there is one that isn't the original singer, it's just because I don't know that they aren't. And because of this, any cover sounds absolutely horrendous to me in comparison. Let's say that I've always heard a cover that I've gotten used to, and know that to be the original song, without knowing who made it first. I'd probably prefer that one over the original of I'd hear the original afterwards. BUT because I ALWAYS listen to the original singers, I don't feel this way.

edit: in my last edit I said that it's possible for me to have listened to a cover thinking that it's the original. I should clarify that I'm talking about hearing songs let's say in a restaurant, or some YouTube video or something and thinking that it's the original version cause that's the one everyone always talks about and listens to. Someone said something about the Whitney Houston cover to I will always love you. That's a great example of this. I don't listen to that song. I never even knew the name before this post. But because that's the one you always hear everywhere, that's the one I knew to be original, even if it's a cover. But when it comes to let's say my playlists. I don't listen to any covers, they are just not good in my opinion. Maybe that's poor wording, not AS good as the original, just because I've heard it way more that I've gotten used to the vocals. That's all this is about.

Men should not have a say on abortion.,3834,vlf3ce,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/vlf3ce/men_should_not_have_a_say_on_abortion/,2689,"As a man, I don’t understand why any man should be able to have a say on what a woman does with her body, ie. Make the decision.

I thought this was common sense?

I don’t understand how some people can be so protective of freedom of speech yet the same people won’t allow the same freedom for a woman to do what she wants with her body.

Further, I believe in cases such as the Roe v Wade case recently regarding a specific sex they should only have the same sex involved to decide the outcome.

**EDIT: Forgot to include this -

I believe they should introduce a document similar to a prenup but to do with abortion which lays out all possible instances where there could be a disagreement between both partners.

1. Both parties take every precaution to not have a child but the woman becomes pregnant - means both parties do not have the baby. 

2. Only one partner takes the precaution (man in this case) but the woman ends up becoming pregnant - both agree that if the man does not want to have the baby he does not have to pay child support if she still decides to have it.

3. Only one partner takes the precaution (woman in this case) but the woman ends up becoming pregnant - both agree that there is no child since it is her body.

Open Letter to Servers & Bartenders: Let’s Not Talk Income,8,tnsf98,Serverlife,https://www.reddit.com/r/Serverlife/comments/tnsf98/open_letter_to_servers_bartenders_lets_not_talk/,244,"We make really good money for what we do, and that kinda used to be our little secret. Let’s try keep it that way. The more it becomes public knowledge, the more likely it is that it will erode our income. 

Some, not all, guests may feel less inclined to be generous to us if they knew how much we were taking home. A tradesperson making $25-30/hr might not see a reason to tip if they know their server/bartender with the “easy job” is making $30-40/hr.

Kitchen staff, we love them, they work hard, we cannot do our jobs without them, their job is a different kind of difficult than ours. But ours involves dealing with all kinds of people, and that’s why we make what we do. When our lovely kitchen coworkers find out how much we make it only creates animosity and makes them want a larger share of that pie. In the US it’s an anomaly for kitchen to receive tip out, but at our place we pass on 4% of food sales to the kitchen. They have a higher wage and that’s a nice little cash bonus for them at the end of the week. But when they hear about a server walking home with $200-300 in a day it gets them all riled up. So please, let’s just avoid talking money with our kitchen homies as it just makes them salty. 

And for the love of god, quit bragging about your best days! If you average $150-200 per shift but you’re going around telling people about that one $365 Friday you had in the month that’s not a good look. How many times I’ve heard servers (who I know) talking about making $300 a day, and I’m like, “Nah gurl/dude, you surpass that threshold on good days, most days are in the $200 range.” Nothing good can come from people thinking we make more than we actually do. 

That is all I have to say on that matter, looking forward to reading your thoughts. It’s Friday, have a good day and go out and make some money!!!

"Restaurants: a waste of time and money, and a limp excuse for an activity",4,wc2suu,Anticonsumption,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/wc2suu/restaurants_a_waste_of_time_and_money_and_a_limp/,144,"My wife and i came back from our honeymoon earlier this month.  I made it a goal for us to avoid going out to restaurants the for the entire 2-week trip, though there were two unfortunate instances where it was not easily avoidable.  The rest of the time, we went to local farmer’s markets to stock up on food to cook back at our cabin. 

When we were planning the trip, i thought back on all of my past vacations, and realized how much time, money and effort were spent seeking out popular restaurants.  Compared to the time i spend at home shopping for and cooking healthy meals, it’s pretty ridiculous to justify all of it.  

But it’s an activity that marks success and happiness for the majority of people. When i told people i was planning on going out of town (to Washington state), they all recommended bars and restaurants to me, and after i came back, they all asked what bars and restaurants i enjoyed while i was there. It should be embarrassing that this is such a top draw for vacations and time off- the amount of time and money you spent on stuffing your face.

I’ve worked in bars and restaurants my entire life, and i completely lost interest in frequenting them early in the pandemic.  I knew firsthand how excruciating the job had become during covid, and i couldn’t fathom anymore being even a minor inconvenience to restaurant workers.  I did take advantage of takeout options at first, but it just proved to me to be much preferable for the employees and for myself- they don’t have to clean up after me and wait on me like royalty, and they still got a %20 tip, and i didn’t have to brave through the dangers of covid for a burrito and a window view of the rush-hour traffic. 

Pre-pandemic, like most people, i would often fill an empty afternoon or evening with a trip to a favorite restaurant with my wife, but it’s clear to me now that those trips were always ways to sparkle an otherwise boring day.  It was like painting bright-colored coats of paint over the crumbling buildings in an impoverished neighborhood- it might be easier on the eyes at a glance, but it does nothing to solve the deeper problems.  In the past two years I’ve discovered what really makes me happy and what amounts to a fulfilling day for me.  

While i don’t wish for anyone to be out of a job, i honestly do wish that more bars and restaurants were shuttered during the pandemic. Maybe then, more people would have been forced to learn how astonishingly simple it is to cook their own meals- and how much cheaper it is, compared to the entire restaurant experience.


Edit:  sure, the idea of not going out and enjoying restaurants anymore sounds cruel and unusual to many people.  But endeavoring an anti-consumerist lifestyle isn’t fun of paper.  Most of what we’ve been fed to believe is “fun” is just profit for the already-rich.  The only restaurants that thrive consistently are giant chains and ones in large cities that are too expensive for everyday people to eat at outside of special occasions, which are the only times i believe restaurants should be enjoyed- not multiple times a week due to mismanaged time.  “Simpler” is boring at first, because we were all raised to need constant stimulation.  After a while, what matters most starts to sift through the needles crap.

Edit II: I’m not saying everyone should live their lives the way i live mine, just wanted to share what i believe is a success story in consuming less of something that people overwhelmingly enjoy without as much criticism as, say, gasoline, or seasonal clothing trends.  It’s still a wasteful and unsustainable system, no matter how enjoyable it may be.",1659202321.0,likeguitarsolo,True,False,False,0.5

Update: Kicked From Roll20 Campaign Because Of My Race,3412,ritd4v,DnD,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/ritd4v/update_kicked_from_roll20_campaign_because_of_my/,1028,"Everything I said in the original post was true, but I noticed a lot of comments asking the same questions/saying the same things and asking for more details, so I wanted to try and address you all. First and foremost, thank you so much for the kind words that most of you gave me. A lot of you were right, I have been absolutely OVERWHELMED with invitations to new campaigns on Roll 20 and other platforms and I thank you, every single one of you that's sent me an invitation!

&#x200B;

I haven't been able to read and respond to every message or every comment just yet because there are so many of them, and it's also a difficult time for my family and I because my father passed away from pancreatic cancer, so I'm spending a lot of time getting affairs in order and making sure the family is as okay as possible. The wound is still fresh, and will unfortunately take time to heal.But I will get to as many as I can as soon as possible! I just ask that you give me some patience. Dungeons and Dragons has been a passion of mine for years and I'm hoping that joining a campaign will be a good distraction from the chaos that is life.

&#x200B;

Now onto answering questions/addressing concerns:

Why is COVID preventing you from participating in your hobbies?

I live at home taking care of my mother who is in her 60s, and until he passed, I was the caregiver for my father for the last 13 years. Both of my parents were in their 60s and extremely high risk due to multiple different illnesses and conditions, so running the streets or going to events hasn't been an option. I also live in a small town, so there are few places where I have the ability to do things like D&D or other TTRPGs. The only spaces available are extremely small and cramped, and therefore not safe for me to venture into when I have to come back home to elderly parents. I'm also high risk myself so it just isn't a good idea across the board.

&#x200B;

Are you interested in other games?

I am! I love Cyberpunk, Warhammer 40K and Age of Sigmar, Pathfinder and Numenera!  I'm also getting into Kingdom Death Monster,

Did this really happen?

Yes, it did.

Can you give more details?

I went looking for a D&D 5E campaign on Roll 20 with the goal in mind of playing Descent into Avernus or Curse of Strahd. I found a group that was pay to play, 15 dollars per session with a free session zero. The ad mentioned that the campaign would be streamed on Twitch, which I didn't really care about. And that the campaign would require an interview process to be able to join, and I'd be contacted directly if I made the cut. They gave me a multiple page long Google Document to fill out that had all kinds of questions on it from my government name, the type of character I wanted to play, stats, previous D&D experience and roleplaying ideas/examples.

&#x200B;

Once I submitted it, I waited until I heard back from the DM of the campaign that asked me to join their discord server for an interview. We spoke at length about my interests/hobbies and they said they felt that I would be a good fit for the campaign after a couple tweaks to my character, which I didn't mind. His table, his rules.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to the night in question, session 0 starts and we all get together in voice chat and the DM asks us to turn our cameras on. I turned my camera on and immediately the entire group was shocked by the fact that I'm African American. The DM himself saying ""WAIT? YOU'RE BLACK? WE HAD NO IDEA!"" and other members saying ""WOW, I COULDN'T TELL!"" and ""You don't type like a black man! You type like a white person!"" That irritated me immediately so I asked ""How exactly does a white man type?"" to which the DM answered ""Well....I don't want you to think less of me but....I'm not used to black people typing properly....You use full sentences and punctuation instead of slang.""  And immediately after that, he made it very clear that he was mistaken and that I wouldn't be a good fit for the campaign after all, and he removed me from the group.

Why haven't you named and shamed these people?

Because I know that goes against the rules of this community. I've even been advised by a moderator NOT to name and shame the individuals in question because that's considered Doxxing and it won't be tolerated.

To everyone that accused me of lying for karma and called me Jussie Smollet:

Listen, I'm a 20 something nerd that grew up on the internet. I know exactly how the internet works, no matter what you do or what you say, there's going to be someone that trolls you. There's going to be someone that calls you a liar, and there's going to be someone that starts shit for no reason. If you don't genuinely don't believe that this happened, then I'm grateful that you're privileged enough to live in an environment where racism and bigotry don't impact you on a consistent basis, but I don't have that luxury. I am a 6 feet 10 inch tall 285 pound black man that is considered a threat by society purely because of the stigma against black men.

&#x200B;

I've been confronted with racism and bigotry every day of my life, and they're things I'll never be able to get away from, because I can't take my skin off. I attend a private, mostly white university, and I'm almost always followed when I'm walking on campus by police officers that have their hands on their weapons. It's hard not to notice that they only have their hands on their weapons when they're walking near or with me, but they don't do so when they're walking with or by the caucasian students on campus.

&#x200B;

I've worked for the federal government and had the police called on me because I ""looked suspicious"" with my bag. Someone legitimately called in a BOMB threat on me because they thought that my bag that contained my lunchbox was carrying a bomb.

&#x200B;

I live in a predominantly white neighborhood and I'd walk to the gym every day pre covid, and every day as I walked from my house to the gym, my neighbors sitting in their cars would lock their doors and clutch their purses as I passed them by, staring at me like I was going to hurt them when I simply wanted to go about my business. I've had threats against my life because I'm African American. I've had people consistently tell me that I'm not welcome in nerd spaces because I'm African American and ""my kind isn't welcome there"". 

&#x200B;

Hell, I'm consistently told that I shouldn't be allowed to cosplay because I'm black and most characters that I've cosplayed are either white, or Asian. My entire life I have been confronted with bigotry, racism and intolerance. So being confronted with it yet again in a D&D campaign isn't anything surprising. It makes me sad, yeah, but it's not surprising. It's just yet another thing I have to deal with in life. But the amazing people of this reddit have shown me kindness that I didn't expect to find, and I'm so grateful for it! And all of the invites I've gotten make me hopeful that I'll find a new campaign to join that'll be an amazing experience.

&#x200B;

 

Just to make one last comment on this:

To everyone supporting me, thank you, truly, it means the world to me, especially during this difficult time for my family and I. To my detractors, I just think it's funny that every time a Person of Color decides to speak out on their experiences with racism, bigotry, sexism or anything of the like, somehow, some way there's always a non POC, typically a Caucasian that absolutely REFUSES to believe anything that we say, often times going to extreme length to try and ""prove"" that we're lying.

Then going even further to say that you WILL believe us, but only if we provide some sort of SPECIFIC proof that you choose, proof that in this case is a Twitch VOD, some sort of chat log, or the names of the people and the discord server in question. And that's funny to me because of the fact that those of you who don't believe me are already calling me Jussie Smollet 2.0 and accusing me of faking this whole thing just to get some karma.

So what would providing proof do other than give you an opportunity to say ""oh this was CLEARLY staged"", because again....you're already calling me Jussie Smollet. You never had any intention of hearing me out, you don't care about proof, you just want to be able to continue to ignore anything that you consider inconvenient. And like I've already said, I'm glad you're able to live in a world where racism and bigotry don't impact you, but that's not the case for me.

&#x200B;

Thank you for all of the support, and for reading my little text blurb,

It is not a discussion. It is not a grammar quandary. It is simple and straightforward: these are Mariah’s pronouns. They aren’t even preferred pronouns- they are just simply pronouns. 

Mariah announced this on social media a long time ago. It has been discussed a lot on this sub. But there seems to be a huge amount of people who refuse to get it and a smaller amount of people who do not know. 

So, now you know. If you make a mistake - it is fine, Reddit has an edit button! Just say sorry, correct your post or comment, and everyone can move on. 

You don’t need to personally understand everything about someone to respect them. Purposefully using “she/her” for Mariah is to purposefully disrespect them, to attempt to erase their identity, and to tell EVERYONE who is trans or nonbinary that you think they are fakers. To respect Mariah’s basic humanity is to use they/them pronouns for them. 

It’s not a big deal. It also isn’t hard. 

Here are some examples: Mariah went to the store and they picked up dinner. When I saw Mariah on TV I felt bad for them because their mother is ridiculous.

Unpopular opinion perhaps but I don't see the problem with locked heroes behind grind/paywall,45,xatuuq,Competitiveoverwatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/xatuuq/unpopular_opinion_perhaps_but_i_dont_see_the/,116,"Assuming that the amount of grinding required to unlock new heroes is reasonable, e.g., doable within say two weeks of normal playtime, I honestly don't see big problems with having them locked behind a grindwall, not even from a competitive integrity point of view. Here is why:

1. New OW heroes are available for QP only before they are released for comp. This period is long enough that anyone who is actively or even semi-actively playing the game (i.e., once or twice per week) should be able to unlock the new hero before it is released for comp.
2. If you cannot do the step 1 above, then it can only mean one of the two things:

* A: You are a smurf who has multiple accounts and you don't have the time or energy to unlock the new heroes on all of them. Tough luck.
* B: You are not an active player and you have not played much OW in a while. Maybe you have not played OW in 3 months and you come back to find comp dominated by the new hero. In this case, not being able to play the new hero is not the biggest problem from a competitive integrity point of view. The bigger problem is that you are washed, cold, and out of practice but you will be likely placed in the same SR rating when you left off. Probably in this case it is better that you play a bit of QP or arcade or whatever, take your time to unlock the new hero and relearn OW before jumping into comp.

So either way, I really don't see any problem with having heroes locked behind a grindwall. Again, this assumes that the amount of grinding is reasonable.

62% of my class got a 5,38,vw7qj9,APStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/APStudents/comments/vw7qj9/62_of_my_class_got_a_5/,157,"So I took the AP Human Geography exam and got my score back as a 5. I was really happy and proud and was gonna celebrate. Except, then I got an email from my teacher congratulating the class and saying 62% of our class got a 5. 

I’m obviously happy for the class and everything but I just feel disappointed. It’s like it’s not even an accomplishment or anything. When I told my parents I got a 5 they didn’t really care that much cuz that’s just what they expect of me. I don’t know. I just don’t feel proud about it anymore. Like all the hard work I put in doesn’t really matter.


Edit:

Hi again, thanks for all the comments. While some weren’t as nice as others, honestly everyone made sense. After being called out, I think I took some time to self-reflect. 

Firstly, I just wanted to say that I totally agree and really appreciate my teacher for everything. I sent an email thanking them like a week ago and am going to send a nice thank you letter too. They were absolutely lovely.

Now, onto the actual thing. I see the issue with such a mindset that I have had throughout my life. That type of thinking’s always been fostered by my parents and is a product of the system. It’s self-centered and just bad.

But, I really really am genuinely happy for my entire class. When I read my teacher’s email, I straight up jumped in joy. Before that, when all my friends said they got a 5, I was happy. I’m planning to throw a party for us friends and have been for a while regardless of our scores because I know we worked hard. Whether y’all believe me being genuine or not, I guess that doesn’t matter anyways.

The day I wrote this post, I was really spiraling with my depression and anxiety and the little voice at the back of my head became too loud. When my parents didn’t even say “good job” and simply said “yeah of course” it really exacerbated that way of thinking. After reading the 62% email, when one of my classmates offhandedly said getting a 5 was like a participation award, it really threw all that joy I had to the ground, leading me to write my original post. I also felt scared and pressured because then I would have to do that good on future ap tests to meet their expectations when I know that I simply can’t and will disappoint them.

Which is why, I’ve been trying really hard to dismantle this way of thinking. Relying on others’ validation for my own achievements is not what I should be doing. I don’t need to meet anyone’s expectations and it doesn’t mean I’m a failure. There’s no need to compare myself to others. We each earned and deserved that 5. That’s all there is to it and that’s what we should be proud of. I’ll get myself a cupcake to celebrate even if my parents don’t. 

This doesn’t excuse anything but just rather me explaining it to y’all and even myself to better reflect. Sorry to everyone.

Thank you all!!

DRS. Hold.  I'm looking forward to the moment when it is shown that the float has become locked.*

# 1. This is MY country

&#x200B;

[You see, Kenneth, I don't just have a copy of the U.S. Constitution.  I also have official copies of the Give Me Liberty Or Give Me Death Speech, the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, the Emancipation Proclamation, The Pledge of Allegiance, other documents, and The American's Creed, which states: \\""I therefore believe it is my duty to my country to love it, to support its Constitution, to obey its laws... and to defend it against all enemies.\\""  You, Kenneth, are the enemy.](https://preview.redd.it/ymxw10k7fre91.jpg?width=3811&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ddc063c94b085979c427325d22e7ad44ffedad18)

Kenneth, I did serve for well over a decade during the War on Terror.  It became a routine to deploy overseas; I sacrificed nearly the entirety of my twenties.  I flew TACAIR (Jets, Strike).  I then spent my early thirties educating myself with over five advanced academic degrees.  The oath I took \[and that you didn't take\] was:

>*""I solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter, so help me God.""*

Yet, everything that I have fought for, for MY country, has led me to today.  This forum.  This New War on \[Financial\] Terror.   ***Thus, I have academically, professionally, and by-oath identified you - Kenneth Cordele Griffin (born October 15, 1968) - as a*** ***Financial Terrorist*** ***and bona-fide enemy of the United States of America.***

&#x200B;

# 2. Facts of the Case

&#x200B;

**Definitions:**

Failure to Deliver (FTD):

&#x200B;

[From the SEC's Failure to Deliver webpage: This is how a Failure to Deliver is defined.  The SEC keeps this 'fuzzy', as can be seen in the definition, in order to shield the perpetrator\(s\).  So, we are forced to use Maths in order to overcome their deception here.  You see, it would have been easy for them to simply allow for identification of 'new' fails as an independent parameter, but they don't.  Further, the data, as is, is global, and cannot be tied to any one entity, hence the source\(s\) sentence.  Again, the SEC does this to shield the identities of the perpetrator\(s\).](https://preview.redd.it/px1aiqobjre91.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=101cb283ada5e54884b91dca834193416e2ef8c0)

&#x200B;

[Notional FTD 'Balances' as graphed in excel.  Values below $25M were used to weed out noise, and values above $100M were considered outliers.  Note that substantial area under the curve occurred, in a similar fashion to January 2021, in June 2022.  It is clear that these failures to deliver \*precede\* major runups in underlying price.](https://preview.redd.it/0s1z0eo71se91.png?width=1221&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddde1df32eb98aa0bf14eea3fa249b4bf93495cf)

&#x200B;

[Further, we can assess the 10-day moving average of FTDs.  As we can see, last month we began to touch upon January 2021 levels of FTDs, indicating that there was a clear attempt for funds to keep the price as low as possible prior to issuance of the dividend.  Also note that FTD data for the dividend period is yet to be released, but the chart shows a runup in FTDs again a week before the dividend.](https://preview.redd.it/muhxwdsoase91.png?width=1165&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fa1758fae637b5a15663f01c34b1d71d8ee9108)

&#x200B;

# 3. Maths and Sciences of FTDs

Based on the FTD definition, we lack *clear* data on how much value has been failed to deliver.  However, that doesn't mean we cannot take a stab at trying to figure it out.

What the FTD definition cannot hide, nor deceive upon, is a rise in an FTD from one day to the next.  By the SEC's own definition, the FTD is a **live balance with no data on the activity underneath the surface**.

As you know from your own credit card balances, if the balance had gone up from one day to the next, then it had to have been due to a spending.  This doesn't mean that you couldn't have paid down that balance somewhat, with an unknown deposit, during that time.  It just means that *spending absolutely outweighed the payback, and AT LEAST by the amount shown.*  Let's simplify this.

We can breakdown the FTD data as either rising day to day, or falling day to day.  There is no way the SEC can get around accounting.  When FTDs rise from one day to the next, we can deduce that NEW shares indeed failed to deliver.  If it falls, we can safely deduce that the balance was lowered.  We can get into the predicament of falling numbers in the next section.

Therefore, we use the statement:

    Minimum number of New Fails  =IF(D2>0, D2, 0)
    
    where D2 is the change (+ or -) from the previous day

and

    Minimum number of ""Fails Settled""  =IF(D2<0, D2, 0)
    
    where D2 is the change (+ or -) from the previous day

&#x200B;

[Then, we go back 18 years and add up all of this.  This should give us the amount of fails to deliver that absolutely were triggered, in raw number of shares, during that span.](https://preview.redd.it/p7t6pt0jise91.png?width=302&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f73032edc9f45dbed923cc9eb946cdeea29738b)

&#x200B;

123,167,765 shares  x  $136.16 \[which is the pre-split-current-price\]

= $16,770,522,882.40

# At least $16.77 Billion worth of $GME (in today's share prices) were absolutely failed to deliver in time over the last 18 years

Let's then graph these New FTDs, by raw numbers of new shares that showed up as new FTDs, and try to analyze - by timing, flux, and order of magnitude - how it correlates with previous price action.  Let's look at before the sneeze, and up to today.

&#x200B;

[We can then graph these 'New' FTDs.  This shows raw jumps in the FTD balance only.  Here is a scatter plot.  The trendline indicates that FTDs bottomed at the end of 2021, but are now 'back on the menu.'  There was a visible 'departure' from the 'low magnitude' New FTDs prior to the January 2021 Sneeze.  Then, there was a 15 month period of notably low magnitude New FTDs.  Now, there is a departure again; from the low magnitude New FTDs to now a flux increase again of high magnitude New FTDs.  Therefore, it is reasonable to assess that the current condition of GameStop stock is that it is now in 'Pre Squeeze' conditions.  These pre-sneeze and pre-squeeze periods reveal exacerbated short-selling of $GME to try to keep the price from running up, yet the data shows that when this happens, it only leads to a more significant runup in price.](https://preview.redd.it/1j2j5w99zse91.png?width=1230&format=png&auto=webp&s=48313157d42666d55899bd1bd2e01736f75893d2)

&#x200B;

# 4. So, we have now proven that we are in 'pre-squeeze' conditions for GameStop, based on New-only FTDs.  But, what is actually happening when the reported FTD number goes down from one day to the next?

The standing community consensus is that hedge funds and market makers 'hide' their reported shorts and reset the FTD clock to where FTDs would not show up on this table.  But this understanding is unclear.

To make this more clear, there should be two categories:

**1.** Shares sold short \[counterfeit, naked\] without the legally-required 'locates' of those shares and then completely unreported (and then completely missing from the FTD table)

**2.** Shares sold short with the legally-required locates and then able to be publicly reported on the FTD table when it does become undelivered.

&#x200B;

Here we are only going to look at #2:

&#x200B;

[$GME FTDs can increase in a day for only one reason: GameStop shares specifically Failed to Deliver.  However, the day-to-day FTD balance, as defined here, can Decrease for a multitude of reasons.  Any stock, asset, or ETF that can be classified as 'like kind' can be substituted for the $GME-specific FTD.  Therefore, there is no requirement for hedge funds and market makers to close out $GME FTDs by purchasing GameStop-specific shares.  This vague definition of \\""settling\\"" FTDs is what opens Pandora's box to manipulation of GameStop.  'Like-Kind' implies any 'meme' stock, ETF, or ANY other security \(even crypto perhaps\) that is self-argued to have similar 'risk' \(i.e. \\""closing out\\"" these $GME FTDs by buying droves of zombified OTC tickers\).  The SEC, by their very definition, is complicit in a complex scheme to hide this activity.  There, very well then, could be at least $16.77 Billion worth of other securities and types purchased in the last 18 years that were used to compensate for the $GME specific FTDs.  The true sum, including category #1 above \(the hidden\/naked\/counterfeit\), would push above $16.77 Billion.](https://preview.redd.it/b9ym6w4n4te91.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&s=93cbcf5883a003106a151135bcfc7b37829cf176)

# 5. TLDR (Conclusion)

It was shown why this country is far more **Mine** than it is Kenneth Cordele Griffin's.  I do own more copies of every core, historical, American founding document.  Further, we analyzed Failures-to-Deliver (FTD) by definition.  Although the white house today is attempting a coup on the definition of recession (to attempt to aid their november political elections) the FTD definition comes from the SEC.  The FTD definition is purposefully-vague (so much so that it can be considered a criminal coverup of accounting activity).

$GME FTDs is essentially an 'active balance' of undelivered GameStop shares, showing no details of activity.  We, however, broke this down to assess day-to-day increases of FTDs to be able to analyze New-Only FTDs.  By analysis, using this data, we showed why $GME is now in a rare 'pre-squeeze' condition.  We then showed how at least $16.77 Billion of $GME FTDs very-well could have been """"closed out"""" simply by hedge funds and market makers buying securities that they argue are 'like-kind' to $GME.  This is the legal-definition-based bridge where the SEC allows bad actors to ""settle"" droves of $GME FTDs by buying non-$GME securities, such as \[newly-made-non-transparent\] zombified OTC tickers, and hiding them behind the \[newly-made-non-transparent\] swaps.

Note: This analysis considered only *reported* FTD information.  The bulk of failures to deliver, however, are estimated to be vastly unreported.  Therefore, the number of **$16.77 Billion** minimum in failures to deliver serves as a baseline minimum of notional value of specific-$GME that was shorted, undelivered, and then ""*""""settled""""""* using either GameStop shares ***and/or*** using 'like-kind' means.

As the title says, today for LUCKY FRIDAY the 13th, DOGECUBE team will give away a bunch of DOGECUBE tokens to everyone who comments on this thread until Friday 13th 23h59 UTC! On top of that we will giveaway 5 NFT prizes to 5 random participants!

What is DOGECUBE?

Thanks to Radix ([radixdlt.com](https://radixdlt.com)) - the next generation layer 1 protocol it is deployed on - DOGECUBE is todays most scalable INU that does not compromise on decentralization and security, all WHILE maintaining full atomic composability!

In the middle of the rise of memecoins and RADIX in 2021, DOGECUBE the 3-headed INU was born as the first INU to celebrate RADIX founder Dan Hughes and its revolutionary DLT protocol: Cerberus. Seeing the rise of web3 communities and the influence that memecoins can have to onboard new users to such a disruptive technology, DOGECUBE’s philosophy is to enlighten market participants around Radix, bring fun events, create new crypto connections and help each other navigate in this mind blowing ecosystem.

A bit like Samoyed on Solana, but bigger, better, faster stronger and with 3 heads! A simple memecoin? Much more, Radix's cute INU Ambassador.

DOGECUBE is unlike other memecoins. First, its supply was airdropped for FREE to members who posted memes in the weekly brawl events against other INUs over the past 6 months, incentivizing creative and fun quality content. Second, by not running any ICO, the token is compliant with global crypto regulations. Last but not least, such distribution system provided a fair sharing of the supply among its community and eliminates the risk of single entities having complete control over market price.

Here’s some of DOGECUBE’s achievements over the past months:

&#x200B;

⭐️ Created in August 2021, 8 billions tokens FIXED supply

⭐️ 25 memebrawls against other INUs tokens, during a 6 months period

⭐️ Organic growth > 4k community (at [t.me/DOGECUBE](https://t.me/DOGECUBE))

⭐️ Listed on XTcom, Digifinex, P2PB2B, Vindax, and more in the pipe

⭐️ Community made automatic swap with Radix pair, providing the first platform to trade Radix altcoins (at [DogeCubeX.live](https://DogeCubeX.live))

⭐️ NFT project launched that features 10 000 NFTs, with the community deciding on traits prior to minting (at [dogecube-wow.com](https://dogecube-wow.com))

&#x200B;

What's even more exciting, our crown jewel, an upcoming decentralized INDEX to be launched in Q1 2023, where DogeCube stakeholders will be able to vote and choose which top Radix altcoin projects are to be included!

This is one of the worst looks a 49ers player even had. So a reporter Grant gives his opinion on Kinlaw as a player, you may like it or dislike his opinion but it's his opinion. And Kinlaw decides to take to him on the practice today and intimidate him and then hope on his live and cry about Cohn's opinion of him and start intimidating him

Obv this has nothing to do with Grant, but with Kinlaw. How the hell does he go on a crybaby tirade about not being treated right bc a guy gives his opinion on him as a player and starts intimidating him and taunting him and then says some weird stuff like ''my family knows who u are and everyone knows who u are''. Sorry? He's threatening to hurt a reportes bc the reporter said his opinion on Kinlaw?  
This ranges from a crybaby immature attitude that can't take criticism to borderline aggressive.

Blaring security flaws and other issues inside this thread.",0,tpdyv8,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tpdyv8/nano_is_in_fact_too_good_to_be_true_please_dont/,311,"**TL;DR - Nano cannot survive nation bans like bitcoin can, the lightning network is a working product. When you tell friends and family to buy Nano, you are putting them in financial danger.**                 

First and foremost, it is **wonderful** to have a product that works, right? I'm sure we can agree with that. But what if you have a product that only works and has been working so long because of security flaws that nobody has noticed enough to exploit.                  

I advise you to check out this short 30 second video on using a non-custodial bitcoin lightning wallet as it's much safer, much more secure, and it comes from the world's most popular crypto asset, Bitcoin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-7XBrSqCI                

Well, what is the problem with Nano? Andreas Antonopolous has said this before on his YouTube channel in this video (The timestamp is 28:08): https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1688&v=fEPW6RXMGmA&feature=emb_title                

To paraphrase: He basically said that Nano hasn't been used at scale enough to compare with bitcoin. This means it's like the skinny guy at the gym who is 5'10"" (178cm) and 140 pounds (63.5KG) laughing at all the guys who are muscular but have a *little* difficulty benchpressing their own bodyweight. The skinny guy, in this example, can be thought of as Nano / the nano community because they think the big buff muscular guys struggling is funny even though they haven't had a chance to lift anything beyond the empty bar at all.                 

**Six months after the above video was uploaded / streamed to Aantonopolous's channel, the Nano Network was given a nearly never-ending spam attack that didn't change until the protocol at its core was changed.**                 

Another blaring security flaw: Bitcoin survived the Chinese-government mandated mining purge. Anything and everything cryptocurrency-related in China is now illegal and that includes running a Nano node. There are less than 100 Nano node runners globally and if governments, internet service providers, or companies in general wanted to forcefully remove these individuals or entities from running a Nano node, they could do so with relative ease, **however, when you take a bitcoin mining operation offline, there are always 10 people willing to rise up and take the place of that mining individual.** When a nano node gets shut down, it gets shut down. There is no incentive to rise up and replace the node that was just shut down.                    

And then there is just systematic and uncontrollable brigading that comes from the Nano community, and it is lead on by the delusional belief that Nano is somehow superior to bitcoin. If you were to check out their subreddit, you would also quickly realize that not enough people are questioning the safety of the protocol. Oh, and let's not forget that Nano cannot work with smart contracts. So it can't do defy or swaps or anything like that.                

Reaction to the delusional from the master himself on twitter: https://imgur.com/a/EPzTXYw                 

Finally, this trend **must** be discussed: price action. In the 2017 bull run Bitcoin peaked at 20k USD while Nano peaked a month later at 35 USD. Bitcoin is now at 44.6k USD while Nano is at 2 USD. This is **not** self-sustaining, and if this trend continues, the amount of bitcoin on the lightning network in USD will likely surpass Nano's total market cap in USD in under a year.

EDIT: Running an optimal Nano node requires server grade hardware or renting a server and deploying a node on that server. You think an ISP or AWS or whatever cloud-hosting platform won't shut it down if someone orders them to do it?",1648361714.0,sgtslaughterTV,True,False,False,0.49

I just don't see the point in holding my MSFT and stuff.

I got in MSFT at $220 and my AAPL is basis $103 but I feel by October MSFT will be at $150 and AAPL will be at $80 or less so I'd rather get out now.

I'm still negative so I'll have no tax consequences, but I'll have wash sales but that's no.biggie for me.

I'll keep my UNH since I'm up 54% since buying it 1.6 years ago and probably keep things like UNP NEE COST and my ENPH.

So anyone else selling all their tech?

I just think MSFT and AAPL will be going down at ver least 50% so why lose money when I can just buy in lower?

I like MSFT and AAPL, but I think tech will get crushed now.

I really think it's one of the dumbest takes the community has ever had. 

Do you even watch the flash show? You think he even compares as an actor to anyone in the mcu or DC universe right now? Lol. he's a TV SHOW actor. That's his caliber. And not even STREAMING Quality. We are talking the damn Cw. Again, the cw. He's a cw actor and you want him in big budget films next to Henry Cavill and the rest. 

I'm sure he's a great guy and is great at what he does. But what he does, is goofy, camby, b movie quality cw tv shows. Lol

A great similar example where this went horribly wrong, is with old Batman. Where they used the voice actor from all the cartoons and games. And he was horrible, terrible for the medium. They cast a cartoon actor in a live action show and told him to be himself like the cartoons. And it was just awkward.  It'd be the same here.

Edit: does anyone honestly think Grant was cast in that cw show because he was the best man for the job? That he's the best actor for the flash they could find?? Hell no. It was about money. They literally go after lower caliber actors for cable tv than someone would for a Hollywood movie. Not just in name recognition, in talent. They have lower standards for it. That's how tv was made. If they had an infinite amount of money, or a big Hollywood blockbuster budget, he'd never even be CONSIDERED let alone cast. He's good at what he does. And that just ain't big Hollywood films. 

MAYBE oneeee day he could, if he's able to show he's capable of stuff in other roles in actual film or high quality steaming shows firsttt. It is entirely and utterly unreasonable to suggest someone who has never proved himself anywhere near that caliber, and commit him to multiple 300 million dollar movies at once. For his first Hollywood gig.. yeah, no? Lol.

So if you think he was the flash on Cw because he was a the best actor that was just perfect for the role, is just flat out stupid.",1649470491.0,YeahhhhhWhateverrrr,True,False,False,0.47
Unpopular opinion: I enjoy playing Arena and the economy works for me,4,ti1pun,MagicArena,https://www.reddit.com/r/MagicArena/comments/ti1pun/unpopular_opinion_i_enjoy_playing_arena_and_the/,98,"I see a lot of people up in arms about the arena economy and this subreddit has turned into an echo chamber of negativity surrounding the economy. It seems like this subreddit has basically lost all enjoyment of the game. 

Well that's not me. I have a lot of fun playing Arena, it's the perfect way for me to enjoy Magic and I can keep up with the economy just fine. So why is that?

Well for one I only play Singleton formats or draft, 60 card constructed formats don't do it for me unfortunately. Being a singleton only players relieves a lot of pressure regarding the amount of rates/mythica you need for deckbuilding. I can pretty much build everything from hyperfocused Golos or Sythis to more thematic decks like Bant Dungeons. 

I play quite a bit and do quite well. I average about an hour of play and win about 56% ofy games. The reward structure works greatly in my favour. I tend to get about 2 packs/day worth of rewards (I buy the battlepass) which means my collection grows steadily. I can do this because this is basically an ideal escape. Paper magic is far more fun but as a young father I can't justify spending evenings or weekenddays away from home every week in addition to my demanding job. Arena's quick games and easy access is perfect for me.

If needed I have the disposable income to buy some gems. I don't pretend to be F2P nor do I have a great desire to be. But I don't have to be a whale to support my playstyle either. Around €20 every set keeps me going just fine for the last few years. 

Keepings these factors in mind Arena really is a perfect way for me to enjoy my favourite game and the economy supports my playstyle just fine. I can see that this doesn't work like this for everyone but in this flurry of negativity I felt a different opinion had a place.

Been researching conspiracies for over 10 years now, and a few weeks ago it all started to make sense. Why they all practice Satanism, why the Vatican has dirty secrets, why humanitie been lied to for hundreds of years, why there is so much evil going on in the world. Why you can't say Jesus Christ on most media/ entertainment networks and stations. The elite know the truth, I feel as it is my duty to tell you all these truths. Jesus Christ is the way, our Lord and Savior. I have started picking up my cross again recently and I urge you, my brothers and sisters to do the same. Ask him to come into your hearts and stay close by him. 

This is the culmination of 1000s of hours of research, and also my own life experience. 

Jesus has given us the task and the duty of putting on God's armor. We are in a time of spiritual warfare, and it truly tests the soul. I love each and every one of you individuals out there, all with your own sufferings and sin, like me. Our lord Jesus Christ gave us a path away from sin, and towards eternal life in heaven. 

2 Peter 3:3-7
 Knowing this first of all, that scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing, following their own sinful desires. They will say, “Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation.” For they deliberately overlook this fact, that the heavens existed long ago, and the earth was formed out of water and through water by the word of God, and that by means of these the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished. But by the same word the heavens and earth that now exist are stored up for fire, being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.

2 Timothy 3:1-5 
But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people.

"Amazing, Cyberpunk 2077 is still buggy as hell",10,vwc3md,PS5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/vwc3md/amazing_cyberpunk_2077_is_still_buggy_as_hell/,164,"I was one of those poor fools who got duped into buying CP2077 on the PS4 at launch.  Endured the utter horror of the sub 1080p blurry as hell image.  The sub 30 gameplay.  And Holy shit the bugs.  I remember trying to keep count of all the bugs I saw while just standing around outside the main apartment at the start of the game.  Stopped at 50.  

Once the ability to get the refund happened I jumped at that and got my money back. 

Now here I am with a shiny new PS5 and while playing through and having an incredible time with my library both new titles and old alike, decided well what the hell.  Let's see how this game is now.  

Welp.  Yeah its much better than it was for certain.  No question there.  Imagine quality is great most of the time and the 60fps gameplay is amazing.  But damn.  It's plain frustrating how buggy the game still is.  

The most frustrating thing is most of the bugs seem to be within actual missions.  Trying to stay immersed In this amazing world while running missions with Jackie or Judy or Panam or whomever and it's impossible as the game just throws bugs left and right.  Audio miscues, like just did a mission with Panam where we stole a vehicle and the entire rest of the mission the vehicles horn was going off.  Nonstop.  Then I see her glitch out of the car on several occasions and float around.  Animations pop around alot.  Mission triggers seem to not have any sort of sync so no matter what is going on the animations will all reset suddenly and go to mission start animations.  Feet not hitting the ground.  Cars just don't act right unless they are the main one at times.  Jumping around or having very odd physics reactions with the environment.  

And this type of list could be said for just about every mission.  Speech cutting out or the cinematics messing up.  Odd jumps in animation alot of the time.  Had several crashes.  Once during a mission the game lost the ability to save properly so the save icon was up at all times, it completely lost sync and had to be hard reset and reloaded.  Shadows still have a bad way of popping in and out while walking or driving around.  And good lord the shadows on people walking around with the RT mode is a joke.  Like little black blobs underneath everyone that have ghosting effects when the people's feet move in and out of the black blob.  

Been gaming a long time, seen a ton of buggy games, but this one man.  This one is special.  It has been this long with this many patches and whatnot and the game still can't even run a main mission without bugs getting in the way of the experience.  Almost an impressive display honestly.

Atleast it runs at 60 though.  There is that.  But phew.  It's shocking it is still this bad after this long",1657522396.0,OpticalPrime35,True,False,False,0.51

*Nothing* about Prime Resurgence is new. It's a streamlined and rapid unvaulting, nothing more. We always had the option to may real money to skip the grind and get a little extra with it. 

I'll be the first to admit that regal aya as initially presented was a horrible deal, but now the prices are on par with unvaulting packs and we get platinum too. What more do you want? No really, what? Especially if this becomes a regular event, it'll be far easier than ever to get all the prime stuff you've been missing.

New Banned Streamer Guidelines.,0,uevf1f,LivestreamFail,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/uevf1f/new_banned_streamer_guidelines/,1754,"Good day to our subreddit visitors and regulars. We have an important rule change we would like to announce to the community, and wanted to put some context around this release.

# Banned Streamers

We introduced our “Ban Request System” just over one year ago. We recognized as a team we just did not have enough mods, tools, or available time among the team to fully curb harassment on this sub to the point we found acceptable, and until we felt that we were able to do enough to stop harassment and other attacks, we did not feel it was fair to deny streamers who did not want their content on LSF.

We believe that this accommodation has been a net positive, as streamers who felt that having their content posted on LSF subjected them to harassment or negatively impacted their mental health could easily address it by getting in touch with us.

We also recognize that how we enforce this rule can impact the average LSF user, who simply wants to use the subreddit as a place to catch up on live streaming happenings for the week/day/etc. As more content creators request bans, and more tangentially related clips and content gets removed because of banned streamer presence, we recognize the need to find a middle ground that allows this content to stay on our platform, while also curtailing the amount of harassment that streamers may receive from LSF. As a result, we have made some changes to how our ban request system works:

# New Ban Request System

**Streamers who request a ban will now have a “soft” ban. Their clips will still be allowed on LSF for people to view, and will still allow sharing of funny and memorable moments, but comments on the said clip will be automatically locked.**

We intend for this to allow more freedom of clipping and sharing moments among our users, while making sure harassment and hatred does not proliferate in the comments and go directly to the streamer.

**This will still be enforced like our old banned streamer rule**: banned streamers who have a presence in other streamers' clips will have their comments locked. This will in turn make moderation of submission titles much more strict, so they do not inject bias into a title for lack of comments.  More specific rules and guidelines will be posted in our wiki soon.

Some quick comments on this rule change. This has nothing to do with “sub traffic,or needing more subreddit views”. When it comes to sub traffic, not only are [we transparent](https://i.imgur.com/XObFJTX.png), but we have no desire to increase said traffic. **We receive no gain, monetary or otherwise, from traffic rising on the sub**, and increased traffic amounts only put stress on our small team that can barely keep up with the “normal” traffic that we have now. The only thing that generates revenue from subreddit traffic is the LSF website, and this was specifically designed so **none of the moderators have any control over the website, nor access to its funds or revenues** [**or lack thereof**](https://i.imgur.com/8dkb10s.png) This also has nothing to do with any specific streamer wanting a ban, any timing suggesting otherwise is purely coincidental.

Second off, we realize that this may lead to a mass of streamers requesting this ban, as leaving the comments up has little or nothing of value to them. We understand this may happen, but we truly believe the trade off for keeping content on the sub is a worthwhile one. The argument that LSF needs to have comments on to keep “streamers accountable” is completely flawed. Streamers were held accountable by many other ways before LSF comments, and will continue to be held “accountable” without LSF comments. Also, the harassment and toxicity that comes with what our users view as “accountability” is just not worth it. We don’t believe that LSF’s value lies within internet vigilantism. Just post good clips, have mature and interesting discussions, and be normal.

We understand that this rule change is a huge undertaking, and this is why we plan on hosting a Q&A and follow up on the 13th of May to touch back with our community and see what the thoughts are about this change. We truly believe it to be best for the sub, and best for content creators going forward. We recognize that we are one of the only platforms that allow content creators to have so much control over their content off of their platform, but we are in a unique situation because of the large amounts of harassment and toxicity that our platform can bring on a creator, despite our [continued and aggressive efforts.](https://i.imgur.com/xlbxDNl.png)

Along with this, we are still developing more tools and rules to further curb harassment and better our sub, expect more announcements and rule updates soon regarding tweets, and other non clip content. We are also expanding our moderation team even more to help make our community a better place. This rule is still in its infancy, and the trial period will help gauge its effectiveness, and tailor the rule more to reach its desired result if needed.

We would definitely like to hear feedback from users and streamers alike on their thoughts on this change. Please comment below.",1651265887.0,electricalpcfire,True,False,False,0.45

>If you do not understand the nature of the attack, there is a high likelihood you have it in your code. Additionally, mitigating the attack has ramifications around the design and efficiency of smart contracts, which can lead to considerable amounts of redesign if you are not aware of the design constraints early on. 

>Since Mid-October, **every Cardano dApp** with publicly accessible smart contract code, has had a similar exploit in their initial smart contract. 

>Privately, Canonical has reached out to SundaeSwap, MLabs, Well-Typed and IOHK to raise awareness of the issue, and to attempt to prevent new dApps from including it.

>A full in-depth description is coming. Additionally, Canonical has been building consensus privately among the Plutus developer community on **how to prevent this exploit, initially through best practices, and ultimately via design changes to the Plutus smart contract system.**

Edit: bold emphasis added to the words the Cardano cult is most likely to ignore.

Edit: Evidently the exploit was found in every dApp with public code that could be reviewed. Is it caused by inexperienced developers?

She's only credited for the art direction and design of the cover album.

The accusation of RV and Yeri being forced into loli concept with Ice Cream, Mhj only did their concept design, she was not, in any way, involved with lyrics of that song, the styling of Ice cream or the MV. The blame there falls on SM.

The NCT Dream argument, Mhj is only credited with the album design of Chewing Gum. She has no involvement with the lyrics, styling, MV, etc. Furthermore, is the accusation that she made inappropriate comments about NCT Jisung, Mhj was not even involved with the NCT Dream Dazed shoot and the comments were made by Ji Woong Choi, the person in charge of the photography. Lastly, she was also accused for the weird storyline in NCT Dream's ""my first and last student"". Mhj has no involvement with that MV as she was not credited and credited only for graphic design.

The Sulli Lolita photos, Mhj again had no part in these pictures at all, and even more is that the actual person behind the pictures Rotta, credited Sulli herself for coming up with the concept.

The accusation that, Mhj admitted that the WMagazine with Krystal was inspired by a movie with an incest plot. There is completely no source for this anywhere.

The accusation that she was sexualizing Fx members during Nu Abo choreo where they show off their stomach, Mhj was not a choreographer. She just did the graphic design part of the Nu Abo comeback.

The pictures on her wall are confirmed to be, in fact, not children but, 18+ year old actresses. The photos of the actresses all come from movies with more questionable storylines so that is up to you to decide if that makes you uncomfortable or not but, they are not photos of naked children.

Mhj was a regular employee under SM until 2017 where she became part of the board of directors, she had no control on majority of SM decisions when it came to concepts, debuting underage members, etc.

The accusations of her saying that the youngest NewJ member is bathing in her innocence have been debunked as a mistranslation, as the actual sentence is ""the youngest is like bright clear weather"". Basically saying the youngest is like sunshine.

This pretty much leaves her liking Brooke Shields and liking weird movies as only two serious accusations. It's your choice whether you think this is problematic or not, but in the case of Brooke Shields I can maybe give some context. Brooke Shields being regarded as exploited is only something that is accepted in recent years. Mhj is the same age as my mother, who at the time also saw Brooke Shields as a model like any other and not specifically an exploited young woman. As stated before you can still be uncomfortable with her even in this context, that is fine. This is not meant to defend Mhj but to give more context as accusations of pedophilia are extremely serious.

These are some of the debunked accusations, you can find more detailed information from the Twitter account I linked. It's fine if you are still uncomfortable by her even after this, but I do want to clear up all the misinformation being spread around.",1658996353.0,Frequent_Shop,True,False,False,0.47

Completely fallen out of love with F1 since Abu Dhabi. Does anyone else feel the same?,111,rldqr1,lewishamilton,https://www.reddit.com/r/lewishamilton/comments/rldqr1/completely_fallen_out_of_love_with_f1_since_abu/,298,"The ending of the season makes me feel so unsatisfied. It feels like Red Bull were only really able to compete in the first place because of the floor changes, but had Max won the title fair and square I wouldn’t have had any issues because that wouldn’t have been the first time a team has suffered and eventually lost due to regulation changes, that’s just F1. It’s more the fact it was robbed from Lewis and gifted to him on a plate by an incompetent Masi. He didn’t put a foot wrong and his 8th title was taken away from him through no fault of his own despite being the better driver that day and in previous races. There was no precedent for Masi’s decision either. Generally, during the season the decision-making was horrendous, there was no consistency with penalties at all and the FIA’s failure to take action after Brazil etc made the latter part of the year far more controversial than it needed to be. 

I’m not a fan of Verstappen at all as a person, as a driver I think he’s unbelievably good and it’s hard to argue against him having deserved the title. However, I think he is a sore loser, very unsportsmanlike and just comes across generally quite sour and arrogant. At the moment r/formula1 just feels like a constant trickle of pro-Max content and I roll my eyes pretty much every time I go on there which is making me lose interest even more. I do feel a bit disappointed that Mercedes chose not to further their appeal because they likely would’ve won, but I can only respect Lewis for not wanting to win the title in a courtroom.

Apologies for the rant but I just don’t feel like I can be bothered to tune in next year. It’s not because Hamilton lost, because I kept watching after 2016 and I likely would’ve done had I been watching in 2007. It’s more that I’m sceptical as to whether we’re actually going to be able to see a fair fight, because if this season is anything to go by and Masi sticks around there’s no way in hell we will. Call me a pessimist but how on earth will the FIA investigating itself possibly lead to any positive change? I also saw a post somewhere today saying that the impending regulation changes will at least initially likely lead to more one-team dominance and based on history I wouldn’t be surprised if this happens.

Und heute wurde ich wieder gut dran erinnert, wieso ich einfach zu 95% kein Bock habe neue Menschen kennenlernen zu wollen. 

Ganz normaler Alltag, Toast und Klopapier ist aus, Pause im Homeoffice eingeläutet und auf gehts einkaufen fahren. Keine zwei Kurven auf ner Hauptstraße gelandet, läuft ein bestimmt 20-30 Jahre Alter Typ in SCHRITTGEWSCHWINDIGKEIT über die Straße, sieht mich ankommen, schaut mich dumm an und geht gemütlich weiter. Super Verhalten, bestimmt ein super Kerl, hatte auch bestimmt kein Bedürfnis extra zu hupen damit er was merkt aber okay, kann ja mal passieren (eigentlich nicht aber was solls) 

Im örtlichen Lidl angekommen der nächste Spaß - Klopapier komplett ausverkauft. Es gibt legitim keinen. K E I N E N einzigen Grund Klopapier zu hamstern. Öl und Nudeln kann man wenigstens ENTFERNT noch ""verstehen"" weil Idioten denken ""scheise Ukraine Krise da gibs bald nix mehr!!1!11"" - was natürlich auch absoluter Gehirntumor ist, lassen wir trotzdem mal so stehen. Aber Klopapier?? WAS IST EUER SCHEIß PROBLEM MAN!?   


Gut, das auch überwunden kann man sich wenigstens wieder aufs Frühstück und Kaffee im Eigenheim freuen. Man(n) macht also noch den Briefkasten auf um Post rauszufischen und was findet man tolles?

Wie kann man so wenig im Hirn und SO VIEL LANGEWEILE haben, dass man sich so einen Hirndurchmarsch ausdenken, drucken und verteilen kann? IN DEUTSCHLAND?! 

Ich kann und will einfach nicht mehr, wenn ich mich daran erinner das so unfassbar viele von diesen Idioten rumlaufen. Bin bei weitem nicht perfekt und bestimmt auch in gewissen Situationen ein Idiot, aber gesunder Menschenverstand ist meiner Meinung nach wirklich was anderes.

"""Gender Pay Gap"" není způsoben diskriminací.",4,w3isnq,czech,https://www.reddit.com/r/czech/comments/w3isnq/gender_pay_gap_není_způsoben_diskriminací/,261,"Z nějakého důvodu se tady často zmiňuje nerovnost v platech mezi muži a ženami.
Tato nerovnost rozhodně existuje a statistiky to ukazují jasně. Vadí mi však, že se tato statistika použivá jako důkaz pro existenci diskriminace zde na západě, což je dost vytržené z kontextu.

Jeden z největších biologických rozdílů mezi muži a ženami spočívá v tom, že ženy se zajímají více o ostatní lidi, zatímco muže zajímají technické věci. Ženy průměrně hůře snášejí stres a riziko nebezpečí. Většina žen se rozhodne dát přednost mateřství, čímž obětují kariéru.

Tyto faktory pak vedou k tomu, že si ženy dobrovolně vybírají pracovní pozice, které jsou hůře placené - na oplátku bývají tyto práce méně stresujicí, pohodlnější a flexibilnější, což ženám více vyhovuje.

Každý v dnešní době ví, že být inženýrem nebo programátorem je velmi dobře placená práce, většinu žen to však nezajímá a jdou raději studovat např. psychologii, které bývají hůře placené.

Nebezpečné práce (rybář na moři) a stresující práce plné zodpovědností (generální ředitel) bývají taky dobře placené - o ty však většina žen zájem nemá.

Ženy pracují průmerně menší počet hodin a berou si delší dovolenou, což se také projeví na menších platech.

Jednoduše řečeno, nerovnost v platech není způsobená diskriminací, ale dobrovolnými rozhodnutími ze strany žen a mužů, které často bývají odlišné kvůli biologickým vlohům.",1658312243.0,,True,False,False,0.5

Acho que todo mundo sabe as coisas que mulheres passam nesses ambientes, eu não fui exceção, mas sempre ouvi coisas que eu considerava idiota e que não valia a pena perder meu tempo discutindo tipo ""vai lavar louça"" e coisas desse tipo. Mas nos últimos meses, eu realmente tenho sofrido por conta do machismo de pessoas próximas a mim ou próximas a pessoas próximas de mim. A começar pelos amigos do meu ex, que descobri recentemente que sempre incentivaram ele a terminar comigo porque eu provavelmente chifrava ele (era relacionamento à distância, mas eu ia ver ele com frequência) e que têm um pensamento de que mulher é um pedaço de carne, só falavam de puteiro. Meu ex sempre subestimou minha inteligência, fazendo explicações longas e detalhadas de dúvidas simples que eu tinha e parecia que ele duvidava que eu tinha entendido. Algumas situações em que eu expliquei alguma coisa pra ele, ele foi tirar d´úvida com outros amigos homens que falaram a mesma coisa que eu, mas a palavra deles tinha mais credibilidade, aparentemente. Meu ex me ""corrigia"" e queria saber mais do que eu na minha área de formação, sendo que ele só tem ensino médio e eu tenho ensino superior. Recentemente, eu fui no discord dele e vi que um dos amigos mais próximos dele tinha orgulho de ter chifrado a namorada e parecia gostar de ver ela sofrer. A última ligação que eu tive com meu ex ele me humilhou até não poder mais, era um ódio absurdo e injustificado. Eu tô num discord cheio de nerdola e eu zoei um cara que me gadou e mandou comida pra mim sendo que eu não fiz nada, só postei que tava triste e não tava comendo direito no twitter, eu fui ridicularizada por 12h no grupo, mas quando é homem que zoa amigo boi eh muito engraçado. Inclusive, provavelmente essa situação vai chegar aos ouvidos do meu ex e vão me chamar de vagabund\* barata ou algo assim por ter aceitado a comida. Esses dias eu zoei que meu ex  mega empresário que ganha um salário mínimo achava que eu queria dar ""golpe da barriga"" nele e um cara começou a ME zoar e ridicularizar??? Atualmente, parece que quanto mais eu convivo nesse ambiente, pior ficam essas questões relacionadas a humilhação. Mais eu descubro como homem odeia mulher. E quanto mais homem junto, pior é. Quando eles estão separados dá pra conversar, mas quando se juntam... Parece que um estimula o ódio do outro. É a primeira vez que passo por isso de forma tão intensa, tô bem chateada. Pior que nem sou o tipo de pessoa que fala muito, eu não costumo chamar atenção e sou muito na minha.

Unpopular Opinion - There is zero good reason to move the Dragon pickaxe,14,tih45w,2007scape,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/tih45w/unpopular_opinion_there_is_zero_good_reason_to/,125,"Common arguments:
Argument 1: ""The DPick is dangerous to obtain, all other skilling tools have non-dangerous sources""

Response:
1. Some items being dangerous to obtain isn't a bad thing. It adds to their prestige and rewards those who are willing to embrace all parts of the game.
2. It isn't actually dangerous to obtain, there are six sources of the dragon pickaxe:
a) Vetion
b) Callisto
c) Venenatis
d) Chaos Ele
e) KBD
g) The GE/trading

If you don't want to obtain the dragon pickaxe from the wilderness, then buy it off someone who was willing to spend the time there. You pay a premium for their more niche PvM preferences.

Argument 2: 
**Something something IRON something something**
Response 1: When I voted in the gamemode it was explicitly stated by Jagex that the mode wouldn't affect the development of the rest of the game. I would easily consider neutering the value of the DPick, which is one of the few big ticket items currently in the wilderness, or removing it altogether as ""affecting the rest of the game"". 

Response 2: As an iron you chose to interact with all parts of the game, and part of the game includes the wilderness.

Response 3: You chose to limit yourself from the sixth source of the dragon pickaxe - the GE the second you chose that gamemode. 

Response 4: An iron with a dragon pickaxe from the wilderness is more prestigious than one farmed form zalcano/whatever other BS content that they want to inflate. A HCIM with a DPick is currently very presigious. Not long ago I saw several pics of HCIM who have completed all wilderness uniques including Dagonhai, all pets, etc. Very few irons, let alone hardcores will ever achieve this, and it something to be left as prestigious.

Argument 3: ""Stop forcing PvMers into wildy to get dpick""
Response 1: You aren't forced, just buy it off the GE. If that doesn't apply to you then see Argument 2

Argument 4: ""Dragon Axe and Harpoon have skilling sources, it makes sense for Dragon Pick to have one too""
Response 1: Dragon Axe was worth 65k when it was dumped on th WT Table as a meme. Nobody seriously grinds WT except very nich 10 Hp Irons for the Dragon Axe. The dragon harpoon was only worth around 100k, and again nobody seriously grinds Fishingtodt for the Harpoon. If they were to be consistent with this they would need to put it on group mining content at a comparable drop rate - that is roughly at half the drop rate of a pet. Again nobody should seriously be able to grind it for the dragon pickaxe.

In addition -  Zalcano already contains the upgrade to the DPick, and its very unusual for the base and upgrade to come from the same source. Zalcano is also massively farmed for its alchables etc which would plummit the value of the DPick - again punishing those who like dangerous PvP content for no good reason.

Feel free to downvote me and make generalisations about me. for some information about me - I have a very high level 31 prayer ironman with several raids and wilderness pets and about half of wilderness uniques completed, having been pked plenty myself and with a K:D ratio of well below 1:2.

TIFU I did not realize some guys can squirt without physical stimulation,13635,w1on4x,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/w1on4x/tifu_i_did_not_realize_some_guys_can_squirt/,1567,"So I have been with a number of sexual partners, and I did not realize some guys can squirt without any physical stimulation.

I met a guy at my friend’s pre-wedding party last week. He was fun and seemed generally interested in me sexually. So I exchanged numbers with him and we basically sexted a bunch up to the ceremony. During the ceremony, I decided it might be fun to give him a BJ before the reception. He agreed. 

I took him to a coffee shop next to the reception venue that I knew, for sure, had single use restrooms for customers. He did warn me in our sexting (during the ceremony) that he tends to cum very fast, especially from BJs. No problem, I will just tease him with words to get him ready. No touching. 

So when we sneaked into the restroom together and locked the door, I got on my knees and dirty talked. When I finally pulled down his pants and boxers, his erection sprung straight out. And that was the last I remember before the searing eye pain.

I had zero warning. Zero. The second his dick sprung to attention, it squirted goo in my left eye and face. I have had MANY facials in my life and none stung like this. I guess I had been prepared in the past and never got any caustic cum in my eye. This burned. 

I ran to the sink to flush my eye under the faucet. He ran out and left me in the restroom, door unlocked. I left with what looked like a pink eye and a wet shirt collar. Fortunately the pink eye subsided by the end of the reception, but not before the wedding reception photos were taken. I also skipped the photo booth. 

I hope the photographer knows how to photoshop out pink eyes. :( 

TL;DR: I didn’t realize some guys with premature ejaculation could orgasm without any touching. I got hit in the eye and ended up with a pink eye in my friend’s wedding reception pics. Lesson learned: don’t give BJs to premature guys at a wedding, before the photos are taken.",1658112796.0,YourInfidelityInMe,True,True,False,0.6

This Glaivier delay speaks volumes about AGS and SG.,8,u8876r,lostarkgame,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostarkgame/comments/u8876r/this_glaivier_delay_speaks_volumes_about_ags_and/,111,"Let me preface this rant by saying that I have a very generous understanding of how Korean software companies operate, having worked with and for many of them during my time as a developer, and even without knowing the intimate details of the communication fiasco that AGS and SG must be having, I can already *smell* the shitstorm that has been brewing between the two companies.

Even if AGS has a team of emissaries to SG with the most brilliant minds that speak fluent Korean and English, working with Korean people is not nearly the same as the western work ethics/behaviour, and that shit doesn't translate well. Even myself as a first-gen Korean, every time I have to deal with Korean companies, it's a fucking nightmare. Not because korean people are shitty or westerners are shitty, it's just a pure difference in mindset, workplace, and priorities. 

Every software company has its own sprint and how it deals with the flow of completing each task or story, but the very *fact* that ""the final testing for April Update"" happened the day before release and **critical** issues were discovered not 12 hours before the release is an absolute embarrassment for both AGS and SG. 

AGS announced April roadmap that included South Vern and Glaivier update. They were ""supposed"" to come out the week before but issues occurred. So the update got pushed to 21st, with exciting marketing piece on Twitter and bunch of articles and videos around the update. And 12 hours before the update we get an announcement that more issues were discovered and so the update will be delayed again. 

So AGS was told that it will be ready by 14th, SG fails to deliver, AGS is again told that it will be delivered by 21st, SG fails to deliver. AGS does QA testing along with SG, presumably the last run of the QA test and presumably SG does its own internal testing before shipping the staging build to AGS, and in all these QA testing neither companies found such critical issues that inevitably led to another delay in product release. 

If this is how my current team runs, our execs would be flipping tables and swapping out our macbooks for thinkpads.

It's disappointing that this update got delayed again. But while many people were really looking forward to the new updates, the issue isn't that this one update got delayed twice now, but that this cannot be allowed to be a pattern in how AGS/SG teams work with each other.

The frustrating part in having said that though is that it's hard to blame SG because SG is slow to deliver to its main audience (KR server) as well, and it already has RU region and JP region, and now dedicating a good chunk of its bandwidth to NA/EU. SG has a fuck ton on its plate, and it will burn and crash unless SG scales fast, which tend not to be how korean companies operate (past two korean software companies that i've worked for serviced millions of customers with an embarrassingly small team of developers and in both cases I had to advocate to the CTO for expanding their team because these guys were literally dying)

And it's hard to blame AGS knowing how difficulty it can be to work with korean companies. But call it bias or what, it becomes easier to blame AGS knowing that we as NA/EU playerbase don't deal with SG but AGS, and it's AGS's duty as our service provider to ensure that its work with SG is as effective and efficient as possible, and knowing that AGS has (or at least should have) all the resources in the world to make that happen.

TL;DR: working with SG must be rough for AGS no doubt about it, SG is probably working all of its developers to the last drop of their soju infused sweat, and they cannot and should not go on like this and really have to find a way to work more effectively, otherwise none of us poor bastards are going to see booba skin.

**Edit:** WELP! It seems like the update is going as planned after resolving the ""critical issue"". Kudos AGS and SG. Point still stands: hoping that moving forward, this kind of back and forth, stringing players around, heart aches and pain will lessen with each passing update.",1650493406.0,letmemakeyoualatte,True,False,False,0.51

Quality of RP is sliding… are there other severs where I can get my RP fix? (Not low effort post),0,tj1big,RPClipsGTA,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPClipsGTA/comments/tj1big/quality_of_rp_is_sliding_are_there_other_severs/,49,"Let me start by saying, I’m probably much older than the average GTA RP viewer. I honestly thought the whole RP thing was a joke prior to actually watching it. When I first started watching GTA RP on NoPixel (three years ago), I was hooked. Legitimately addicted - could not take my eyes off it. I consumed it like nothing I had ever consumed before. Multiple hours everyday, sneaking in a view whenever I had the time. The story arcs were better than anything I had watched before, and they could go off the rails at any point - nothing scripted. It made me nervous and excited at the same time. It was truly a captivating, incredible experience. It was immersive to the point that I would not read recaps, but would catch up on vods to see every minute of context. Wow, talking about it makes me sad. 


Now, I can’t watch more than a few hours a week, if any at all. It’s not because there aren’t very solid RPers, because there are many and they are very entertaining. It is because these people have interactions with others who could care less about being immersive, and it ultimately ruins the experience for me as a viewer. It’s crazy to think of the potential this place has… the developers are exceptionally talented and there are veteran roleplayers who are witty and creative…

All of this has been said many times before and will be said many times after, but the state of things really bums me out. With that being said, what are other GTA RP servers that have solid RP that you all know of? (Preferably with evenly applied consequences for IC and OOC actions)

I would appreciate any guidance as I love GTA RP, it takes my mind off of hard days at work (and life) and I don’t want to have to leave it. 

Mods, I hope this isn’t low effort, I tried to give it a little more to meet the criteria.

But get this.  AGS has confirmed SO MUCH for future content (and there are so many possibilities for the future that are unconfirmed).

We haven't even explored half of the entire map.  People are crying about Everfall and Windsward.  Who's to say those territories won't just be chump change some day?  Think bigger people.

AGS plans on releasing more dungeons (and mutations), more PvP options, more weapons, more events, MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE, in the future.  JUST CHILL OUT.

\-I'm saying it's the Beta version, acknowledging all the bugs and exploits.  I agree, some of them are brutal and need to be fixed.  I'm not saying its OK that they released the game the way it is.

\-$40 for a game where most of us have played for a few hundred hours is awesome value for your dollar.  There are AAA games that cost $60 and you put them down after 50 hours.  There's no also subscription for this game.

\-No I am not part of a company that owns Everfall or Windsward :)

\-I feel like my post was a little harsh on those that have put in 1000+ hours.  My point was if you are bored with the game after 1000 hours, and feel like there is no content at this point, then that's because you are burnt out and ran through all the current content.

\-Ultimately I am just excited about the future of the game.

right now the right is on the better side of history.,67,w8zlfc,conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/w8zlfc/right_now_the_right_is_on_the_better_side_of/,380,"Many people on here claim to be against binary politics.  That's understandable.  Both parties have let us down.  But I would be highly confident saying that the left, as is right now, has let us down more.

The reason it has let us down is because it's promoted increasing federal scope, and believes, with religious excitement, an inevitable global scope of control (globalism) as a ""New Heaven and New Earth"".  If you believe that the world isn't already globalized then you are blind.  Globalization is simply making the world adopt a preferred frame, rather than allowing people to define and enjoy their own frames.  If your nirvana is disneyland, and you plan on staying there forever, that's fine, but if you force anyone to live there against their will, and use force to prevent them from leaving, then you a tyrant and evil.  You are a parasite that feeds on misery in order to feel like you matter.

The right as I see it (who believe that society needs a pinch of government, rather than 3 cups of government.  Those who 100% are against globalism), is on the right side of history for fighting for the case that individuals matter more than groups of individuals.  A person on the right is more apt to call out the dangers of globalism.

The left wants globalism, is working to have it come about, because it's hypnotizing people into thinking that we aren't already coexisting.

Here's the problem with that, by adopting more oversight and control, by requiring more institutional facility, it creates a centralized point of failure with no redundancy.

For example:  If california become's tyrannical, move to a new state, it's your right.  You have that right.  Imagine being in california and not being able to leave because all states are the same.  California government fails, and all of it's old and new departments fail along with it.  Even state homeless shelters, and food banks.  All of these fail.  Too much is encapsulated.  A programmer wouldn't want one class in his software to do everything.  He or she wants functionality broken down.  He or she wants everything small and modular with clear and concise exception handling.  If one class fails to function properly, the application should be able to continue running.

The left, currently, wants this tendency to continue.  While the right, wants to break government down and wants to make it easy for small businesses to operate, creating smaller points of failure for goods and services rather than one macro point of failure like a big corporation.

Crony capitalism is bad for the same reason that socialism is bad.  They are corrupt for the same reason.  Vote for candidates who work to remove the power of their own jobs.

Binary politics are a necessary evil, and if you want to be bipartisan, be partisan with whichever party is doing the right thing.  Don't be loyal to a party, be loyal to what will protect everything that you take for granted.

The left has failed the common people, and continues to do it.  The reason it fails is because they are not humble.  Not humble in a spiritual superiority way, they are plenty humble that way, but humble in that they can't identify their own psychological capacities for abuse and harm.  They view themselves as better than that.  The right acknowledges that primates like us abuse power, the founders did too, and in the constitution are failsafes written with the bitter taste of England's monarchy in their mouths.

Once the left starts aiming to reduce the size of government, allowing people to say things without persecution or consequence, allowing them to save more money, then I will vote democrats.  

The right constantly acknowledges the failures of fascism.  The left, either overlooks, or celebrates historical communist tyrants.

The party system is not perfect, just like how anything is not perfect, but it's still necessary.

I notice a lot of people who voted for Biden are now ashamed of their choice and are decrying the party system.

Be honest, you were mislead.  You are vulnerable and naive like every other human being on earth who thinks they are good.

Don't be good, or bad, be whole.

Get tough, be brave, and use the system to vote out the people who openly and happily abuse you and the system.

If you vote for somebody and feel that it requires bravery to vote for the person, then you are voting for the right candidate.  Your conscience is in line with the vote, but pressures that do not respect your conscience are trying to scare you into submission.  Either by making you feel hopeless,  or outright bullying you. 

The media can not be trusted because it's paid for by people who hate you.  Think about it.

What´s up with all the Dem shills here?,311,wpuh0r,conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/wpuh0r/whats_up_with_all_the_dem_shills_here/,1163,"Am I the only one that´s noticed a trend where everyone that supports Trump or the Republican Party are instantly bombarded with the old *""there´s no difference between the two parties, both work for the shadow government""* argument; but somehow that rarely or never happens if someone is openly a Democrat or says something positive about Biden.  It´s almost as there is an intentional effort here to make everyone that vote Republican think that it doesn't matter what they vote and it´s all the same, but those that vote Democrat are left alone.. What do you think, have you guys too started to notice the same Dem shills as I have?",1660656796.0,CryptoDApper,True,False,False,0.56

Mods can we take back control of this sub please? GME is the only ticker,601,vruey6,Superstonk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/vruey6/mods_can_we_take_back_control_of_this_sub_please/,320,"Seriously? It's so obvious this sub is full to brim with shills promoting BBBY in anyway they can...


Things they say in all the posts:


- ""Why can't we have two moass tickers?""
- ""Are you calling RC a liar""
- ""We need to dig deeper""
- ""RC bought so I bought""
- ""BBBY will squeeze...move higher etc...""
- ""Why can't I make money on BBBY and use it for GME""
- ""If we squeeze BBBY then that's good for GME""


Are we all going blind? It's all a toxic attempt to distract us from DRS. They know we are winning.  Watch them comment on this post defending BBBY. If you're a true GME autist you know DRS GME is the only way. We've done the DD. If you encounter enemies you're going the right way. 


Mods are you compromised or just lazy with all these BBBY posts?
 
Can we at least hold a vote?
